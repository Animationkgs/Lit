Animation [6k]: Exercise makes a difference
alfalfa [5k]: yes, i have really missed the pool
Animation [6k]: what about yoga
alfalfa [5k]: my wife does that, but i don't have the patience
Animation [6k]: ;)
Now [4k]: I do some yoga, focusing on hip flexibility exercises
Animation [6k]: I do breathing exercise
Animation [6k]: Bhastrika pranayam
Now [4k]: to have great hip flexibility is great for men also
Now [4k]: oh that´s very good
Now [4k]: I do aka dua
Animation [6k]: What's that?
Now [4k]: The Aka Dua is essentially an energetic technology and tool for spiritual awakening and attainment of a higher level of consciousness - think who am I, what am I, and why am I here. And yes, it is as well an extraordinary tool for self-healing and the healing of others, opening ones access to higher level energies from within the Quantum Field..
Now [4k]: The words AKA DUA are Egyptian and defined as “unity uttermost shown”, and it is a physical substance with energetic properties that emanates a field of energy.
alfalfa [5k]: roll another one!
Animation [6k]: interestimg ;)

Now [4k]: you become one and whole
alfalfa [5k]: got there a couple of times when i was young, hard to maintain
Animation [6k]: Life is all about the attitude, i guess
alfalfa [5k]: of course everything is unified whether i recognize it or not.
Animation [6k]: To be honest, i have a very dark view of the world nowadays
Now [4k]: yes but when you feel it it becomes real
Now [4k]: yeah i can tell animation, key is focusing on your world
Animation [6k]: For me it's all about surviving
alfalfa [5k]: modern life re-fragments one
Animation [6k]: Hmm
Now [4k]: indeed, it´s like involution rather than evolution
alfalfa [5k]: living in nature is when i feel the most "whole"
Now [4k]: yes nature helps a lot
Now [4k]: it´s an everyday work
Now [4k]: spiritually, it is known as raising your frequency
Now [4k]: the lower you are, the more boxes you are in
Now [4k]: and higher, like wholeness
