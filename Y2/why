yuki [5d]: ça se passe quel jour ?
Gonzalate [4d]: plus vite svp
tuquedenne [4d]: oui c'est vrai qu'on attend un peu...
DiGigot [7k]: fait suer, le blitz
Pingu007 [?]: et nous on cherche un 3 et 4
Pingu007 [?]: non rien
DiGigot [7k]: en blitz vous jouez moins bien, on a pas le temps de comprendre quoi que ce soit, et en plus vous perdez au temps.
tuquedenne [4d]: mais trop pas !
tuquedenne [4d]: ya eu zéro défaite au temps en 8èmes
yuki [5d]: je connais que sf pour perdre au temps
Gonzalate [4d]: ou des mauvais perdants genre jer
DiGigot [7k]: ok je retire "vous perdez au temps"
yuki [5d]: jer c'était pas défaite au temps
jeandoute [4d]: ben alors
Gonzalate [4d]: vous commencez ou quoi
yuki [5d]: tanguy fait la sieste
Gonzalate [4d]: on vous jette des cartes de coinche dans la face sinon
DiGigot [7k]: en blitz vous jouez moins bien et on n'a pas le temps de contempler et réfléchir
gosushi3 [4d]: faites le durer ce blitz au moins
DiGigot [7k]: et comprendre qq coups.
yuki [5d]: réfléchir même les joueurs ne font pas ça
DiGigot [7k]: 10sec, quoi -_-
tuquedenne [4d]: mais si, on réfléchit, mais à un autre format
tuquedenne [4d]: le blitz 10 minutes, on a le temps de réfléchir
tuquedenne [4d]: le blitz 10 secondes en temps japonais c'est beaucoup trop rapide mais personne de sérieux ne joue comme ça
DiGigot [7k]: quand on est entrainé on réflichit "plus vite" parce qu'il y a des trucs sui viennent tout seul
tuquedenne [4d]: 10 minutes mort subite et voilà, c'est un vrai blitz
yuki [5d]: faudrait créer un sondage
DiGigot [7k]: ou 30sec horloge japonaise quoi
yuki [5d]: blitz vieux vs blitz jeunes
Kingu [-]: je pense que DiGigot ne supporte pas d'avoir perdu en 32e
bolbi [-]: je pensais 10 minutes mort subite ne se justifiait que par l'utilisation de pendules mécaniques
yuki [5d]: ça c'est plus du blitz DiGigot
tuquedenne [4d]: :), Kingu
DiGigot [7k]: :D
tuquedenne [4d]: bon elle est où votre partie yuki ?
DiGigot [7k]: nan je parle de ma perception du spectacle :)
yuki [5d]: j'attends que tanguy m'invite
tuquedenne [4d]: sinon, @bolbi, probablement oui originellement mais en fait je trouve ça vraiment mieux que 10 sec * 3 car tu peux décider de quand est-ce que tu mets ton temps de réflexion
yuki [5d]: faut déjà qu'il se réveille de la sieste
Pingu007 [?]: mais je cmprends pas : y a pas débat, un blitz c'est 10 min MS et pis c'est tout
DiGigot [7k]: ah ok
tuquedenne [4d]: après c'est comme le pair-go où on a rajouté une période de byoyomi, on pourrait penser à 10 min + coup instantané à chaque fois genre 2 secondes
Gonzalate [4d]: bon
gosushi3 [4d]: bon si vs cpmmencez pas on vous offre bien mieux avec soso
DiGigot [7k]: la canadienne aussi c pas mal
yuki [5d]: allez tous spam tanguy en mp
Gonzalate [4d]: moi je retourne faire des vrais trucs
tuquedenne [4d]: bon il y a Cassis0 vs jeandoute à 18h15
DiGigot [7k]: faudrait un truc genre 10min+5x20
bolbi [-]: tu perds moins souvent au temps en 3X10s qu'en 10 minutes mort subite
Gonzalate [4d]: ah ça
Gonzalate [4d]: c'est pas vrai
tuquedenne [4d]: si ça continue le 2ème blitz va commencer avant le premier
Gonzalate [4d]: et j'en témoigne
tuquedenne [4d]: bah 10 minutes MS ça s'apprend
Gonzalate [4d]: voilà
yuki [5d]: c'est pas une mauvaise idée ça tuquedenne
DiGigot [7k]: perso je préfères kibbitzer ici que sur le blitz, na.
tuquedenne [4d]: c'est sûr que si t'as jamais joué qu'en temps japonais et pas en mort subite, les premières fois, tu tombes
DiGigot [7k]: un compromis quoi : 10min + 5x20
yuki [5d]: mon premier tournoi ffg c'était en mort subite, dure expérience
jeandoute [4d]: sinon nous on démarre dans 5 minutes
bolbi [-]: je ne joue jamais de blitz de toutes façons, j'oublie de respirer
tuquedenne [4d]: :)
DiGigot [7k]: perso je dirais x30 mais bon un compromis est un compromis
tuquedenne [4d]: pompom jeandoute
tuquedenne [4d]: 10 minutes + 5*20 c'est plus du tout du blitz
DiGigot [7k]: bolbi :)
tuquedenne [4d]: c'est une partie moyenne
tuquedenne [4d]: pourquoi pas mais ça n'a rien à voir
DiGigot [7k]: ok
Angedu06 [9k?]: coucou
DiGigot [7k]: partie rapide je trouve, mais pas blitz
DiGigot [7k]: voir le classement de l'automacth en fait
DiGigot [7k]: le format le plus rapide de l'automatch, genre, si vous voulez jouez vite
DiGigot [7k]: *jouer
DiGigot [7k]: ou l'intermédiaire si vous voulez... La lente sérieux comme spectacle c'est trop lent :)
DiGigot [7k]: je parle donc bien en tant que spectateur hein.
DiGigot [7k]: d't'façons vous ferez ce que vous voulez :D mais bon
DiGigot [7k]: lire ma fiche.
tuquedenne [4d]: oui, mais des parties moyennes, il y en a souvent sur tous les serveurs (fox par exemple pour voir des très forts)
bolbi [-]: "mais bon, je ne lache pas le morceau !"
tuquedenne [4d]: le blitz avec des joueurs forts, c'est plus rare, c'est pour ça que j'ai trouvé ça sympa à organiser
yuki [5d]: ah c'est pour ça que gosushi3 et solal n'ont pas participé
yuki [5d]: "joueurs forts''
jeandoute [4d]: on y va nous
tuquedenne [4d]: allez !
Kongbu [21k]: Pellet
Kongbu [21k]: Enfoiré
Kongbu [21k]: pourquoi t'as abandonné
Kingu [-]: pour te faire rager en public
Kongbu [21k]: hahahaha

[22:08:46] isbhal: hi
[22:08:59] isbhal: welvang 1p is blitzing for big tournament !
[22:17:21] Kingu: pas cher !
[22:20:03] dayharri: en garde?
[22:21:23] motoinari: اچھی شام. آپ سب کیسے ہیں
[22:26:31] LinuxGooo: one question: Do you think, "Blitz" is helpfully for progressing in GO ?
[22:27:30] debaser: I don't think so no. The only think it tests is your 'default' rank, in my opinion
[22:27:35] debaser: thing*
[22:27:54] mongo: qualified yes
[22:28:42] mongo: i would say dont only play blitz
[22:28:49] mongo: play slower games too
[22:29:15] mongo: but blitz can help develop reading
[22:29:21] mongo: iho
[22:31:30] mongo: one idea is to have two accounts..
[22:32:44] DeaconJohn: blitz can be helpful if you review your games.
[22:37:52] LinuxGooo: two accounts ... ah. that might explain why I see some players all time offering blitz games for ranking
[22:39:04] mongo: you could compare ranks..
[22:39:24] mongo: but theyd probably be agains different sets of opponents..
[22:39:26] LinuxGooo: occasionally I did last days some blitz games. Just come back from one game which I won. It feels, that the extreme time limit forces me to speed up in reading. Which I like. Normally I like long games. In tournaments I play much better as mostly on Go servers its around 10-20 minutes games.
[22:39:39] mongo: so kind of incomperable
[22:41:06] Feg: does anyone know why the "resume" button might be greyed out?
[22:41:07] mongo: right
[22:41:26] mongo: thats why kgs rating dont match aga for eg
[22:41:26] FightorDie: be positive
[22:41:40] FightorDie: bob marleay
[22:41:40] mongo: yes, thats why!
[22:42:12] mongo: feg: no games to resume?
[22:42:39] Feg: no i have two games against my opponent saved
[22:42:53] Feg: but he cant press the button cus its greyed out
[22:43:03] mongo: hmm
[22:43:23] mongo: who is it?
[22:43:38] Feg: his name is jakubonfur
[22:43:47] Feg: we are new here
[22:45:41] Feg: mongo - did you change something?
[22:46:02] Feg: he has a [?] now against his name
[22:46:16] Feg: but still the resume is grey
[22:46:57] mongo: donnt know
[22:47:08] mongo: but i couldnt open his info
[22:47:10] mongo: now i can
[22:47:18] Feg: he had no [?] before but has now
[22:47:19] mongo: how about he re logs in
[22:47:30] mongo: yes some thing changed his status
[22:47:33] Feg: ok
[22:47:45] Feg: are u admin here?
[22:47:46] mongo: seeme like kgs didnt recognize him
[22:47:49] Feg: ok
[22:47:51] mongo: no
[22:47:52] Feg: thanks
[22:47:55] mongo: just guessing
[22:47:58] mongo: welcom
[22:48:07] Feg: he still cant press it
[22:48:14] Feg: who is admin
[22:52:39] mongo: is it may 7 13x13 game?
[22:53:16] mongo: move 75 white to play?
[22:53:25] mongo: hes white?
[22:53:43] mongo: im looking at it
[22:53:47] mongo: now
[22:54:39] mongo: anyway he doesnt have that game in his games list
[22:54:48] mongo: but you do
[22:56:40] mongo: in fact he doesnt have any games from before may 7
[22:56:58] mongo: so looks like his history was lost somehow
[22:57:47] mongo: he lost his ? again and i cant open his info
[22:59:13] mongo: oh now it back..
[22:59:16] mongo: weird
[23:00:01] highhand: last person needed fightordie rengo game, suit 10k or stronger
[23:01:08] suerte: stakeout [9d?] is out for a game  *_*
[23:03:11] torooo: yyyy, cheater vs stakeout pleeeeeease

[23:15:26] sukbchoi: hello E.
[23:17:09] domie: catch ? what's the difference ?

[23:17:33] domie: :)
[23:18:10] domie: how is N-Y these days ?
[23:18:17] sukbchoi: is there a way that I can 'group add to buddy list' or 'group censor'?
[23:18:44] sukbchoi: New York City is still empty with slightly more people driving.
[23:18:51] domie: you censor so many people ? :)
[23:19:08] sukbchoi: sometimes I want to censor 'everyone'.
[23:19:30] domie: I just censor highhand but I get a big red cross, that's silly
[23:19:50] sukbchoi: what's highhand?
[23:20:01] sukbchoi: that's the name of player?
[23:20:03] domie: a weird guy
[23:20:33] sukbchoi: let me see his (or her) info.
[23:21:35] sukbchoi: he seems enjoying rengo.
[23:21:49] domie: indeed
[23:22:25] sukbchoi: I have hard time playing pair game including rengo and double tennis.
[23:22:53] sukbchoi: It seems everytime I play, I hurt my partner more than our opponents.
[23:23:13] domie: oh
[23:23:27] sukbchoi: In tennis, I always hit my partner's head when I serve.
[23:23:36] domie: lol
[23:23:55] sukbchoi: no matter wher and how low he stands.

Welcome to the English Chat Room, the place to chat.
slagoo [?]: History is good to learn
slagoo [?]: could save someone's life one day:
tomicus [?]: how did I get myself to the point where I'm four contracts deep into my current job, which means I need to keep four bosses "happy", there was some sort of proverb about "serving two masters", yea, I got four
tomicus [?]: Matthew 6:24
tomicus [?]: yea, I can do research
tomicus [?]: google helps
LinuxGooo [9k]: at least you can write 4x nice bills, tomicus. :-)
Marathon [8k]: trump is removing an inspector general in the state department
LinuxGooo [9k]: Trump is used to ride on a razor blade all his life, marathon. It seems he can do it same way in this corona emergency situation. Would be one of the first dicators who feel over a virus to loose his power. :-)
LinuxGooo [9k]: like in Go. If you evalue a situation wrongly, you get punished. Trump is naive to think he can keep control over a nasty virus. :-)
LinuxGooo [9k]: latest next winter comes the next big wave :-)
Meepy [-]: wheee!!!!
slagoo [?]: you need to do more research tomi,  more the better
LinuxGooo [9k]: with Trump we will see the proverb par excellence: More higher one climbs, more deeper he can fall.
slagoo [?]: never stop researching for more information ever
LinuxGooo [9k]: I am a trueffel pig of data :-)
Epsilion [5k]: tom please tell us the story about your sub-sub-sub contracted job again?
Marathon [8k]: it's not just the virus. trump is corrupt, but whatever happens, his approval rating stays between 40% and 45%
tomicus [?]: I just did epsi, keep up
Epsilion [5k]: *strangles tom violently*
Marathon [8k]: 36% of the u.s. population think trump is mishandling the pandemic, but his approval rating is still between 40% and 45%
slagoo [?]: https://mynews4.com/news/local/winnemucca-toddler-killed-by-rattlesnake-bite-family-says-local-hospital-didnt-do-enough
tomicus [?]: it's on my mind because there are 3 contracts comming to an end, I have no idea what is about to happen, it's a fur ball
Marathon [8k]: there's a complaint that the secretary of state and his wife were having state department employees do errands (not job related) for them.
slagoo [?]: This girl died of rattlesnake bite because the hospital didn't do enough
slagoo [?]: you gotta rely on your own knowledge
LinuxGooo [9k]: girls should never play with rattle snakes ...
slagoo [?]: snakes are frightening
slagoo [?]: I saw a snake in 2018 in Indiz
slagoo [?]: *India , udupi
LinuxGooo [9k]: yeah its a deep swamp of corruption all around Trumptitumpti ...
tomicus [?]: or small boys, I was one once, grabbed a water snake by the tail, bad idea, it had room to turn it's head and bite me
Marathon [8k]: was it venomous?
slagoo [?]: i was walking outside down the road in he evening and i saw an adult snake on the left in the grassy ditch area just moving along its merry way
tomicus [?]: no
tomicus [?]: but I thought it might be and scared the crap out of me
slagoo [?]: india has like 50000 people die every year from snakebites
Marathon [8k]: did it break skin, tom?
LinuxGooo [9k]: water snakes .... hm ... sea snakes also known as coral reef snakes have the most toxic poison in the world. Death comes quickly. But they are very gentle ...and not aggressive. Cool diver. But must come back to surface as they have lungs .... I like them.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rqcigdJi3o
tomicus [?]: it did, I had cuncture scars, if I look hard enough I might still find them
slagoo [?]: the snake i saw was as big as me
slagoo [?]: It must have been 4 feet long and moving at full speed
tomicus [?]: *puncture
LinuxGooo [9k]: I love Cobras ..... in India they are seen as holy ;-)
LinuxGooo [9k]: where you live in India, slagoo ?
slagoo [?]: yes, i was visiting in Udupi
slagoo [?]: It's on the western coastal area on the arabian sea
slagoo [?]: It's a small town
slagoo [?]: this was in august 2018
LinuxGooo [9k]: yeah ... in Karnataka ....
slagoo [?]: i was walking down a side road against a field
slagoo [?]: It was after 6pm and the sun was setting and i saw it on my left going down the road in the ditch at the left side of the road
slagoo [?]: i stopped and went back home immediately walking in the center of the road
slagoo [?]: There are still snakes in the country area
LinuxGooo [9k]: normally snakes do not attack humans, regularly. They cant hear (snakes have no ears), but can feel the vibratinos of your foot steps. And normally escape. Only if they are cornered, and feel threatened ... they defense themselves by biting (or spitting venomen).
tomicus [?]: can't find them, shed enough epithelial cell off your hand and eventually they go away, now I'm sad.  I don't have tatoos, but I am proud of the scars I racked up, weird philosophy, I know, but I also have Feynmans take on philosophy, don't get me started
LinuxGooo [9k]: you could tattoo a scarf which looks like a snake bite, tomicus ;-)
tomicus [?]: well, grab one by the tail, it kinda notices that
slagoo [?]: my point is there is danger lurking at all times
LinuxGooo [9k]: not a good idea to grap a snake at the tale. Some can twist around 180 degrees quickly.
Marathon [8k]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdWukgu1q8Y
slagoo [?]: only the alert can survive this world
slagoo [?]: The rest depend on the sweet mercy of strangers
LinuxGooo [9k]: You must look a cool YT channel of a US guy, he is known as "Viperkeeper". He breeds venomenous snakes, and does a lot of camera close ups of green mambas, cobras, rattle snakes, Taipans etc. .... he explains a lot about the behaviour of snakes. Its very interesting.
LinuxGooo [9k]: imagine, you look into the face of a high toxic mamba as close up on your screen. Thats an Adrenalin kick :-)
slagoo [?]: don't let yourself be misled into a false sense of security and become victim to the sweet mercy of strangers








Welcome to the English Chat Room, the place to chat.
slagoo [?]: this seems like a momentous time
SamSpade [2d]: so sailors can get infected again
Marathon [8k]: there may be no immunity following infection
SamSpade [2d]: is that possible?
Meepy [-]: sure
tomicus [?]: the common cold, mark 2, I'm not saying that's what it is, but I have an imagination
SamSpade [2d]: so how did the body get rid of the infection
Meepy [-]: awkward silences
SamSpade [2d]: I hate those
Marathon [8k]: if there is  no immunity following infection, it  may be difficult to develop a vaccine. if a vaccine is developed, its effect might be of limited duration
Meepy [-]: this is known
Marathon [8k]: of the many coronaviruses, 7 are known to infect humans.  4 of those are causes of the common cold. after recovering from a coronavirus common cold, immunity lasts for about 3 years.
SamSpade [2d]: so this virus could permanently change the way we live, huh
tomicus [?]: viruses have an anoying habit of mutating, this one is supposed to be kinda stable, but still
Marathon [8k]: that's what i'm afraid of, sam
LinuxGooo [9k]: Marathon ... such results of re-testing had been in China and South Korea, too. But in South Korea they said, the test indicaed dead parts of the virus in the body. So it was no more active.
slagoo [?]: Kids are affected as much though
slagoo [?]: *Aren't
Marathon [8k]: the other 3 coronavirus that infect humans cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19
Marathon [8k]: linux, these sailors previously tested negative. they tested positive again after developing flu like symptons again
Marathon [8k]: RNA vaccines are starting to look better
LinuxGooo [9k]: there is a new illness now with kids, eventually linked with covid-19. WHO warned yesterday .... already heard of MIS (= multisystem infectious disease syndrome) ?  Here some more details about MIS-C (here C stands for children) ...  https://abcnews.go.com/Health/200-cases-doctors-warn-reports-rare-coronavirus-linked/story?id=70703314
tomicus [?]: this just turned into work, on my day off, laters people...
LinuxGooo [9k]: aha ... yeah, my sailor colleagues ... I wait also for the test. Medical centre for seafarers in Amserdam yet had not made a decision.
SamSpade [2d]: Vietnam: people lining up to donate their own lungs to a foreigner
SamSpade [2d]: they really don't want a single covid-19 death
SamSpade [2d]: madness
LinuxGooo [9k]: hm .... there was just a lung transplanation for a British guy who had covid-19 ...  only read the headlines. So have no further details yet.
LinuxGooo [9k]: Italy just decided, that they will allow again international travelling from 3rdn June on. Here we go .... back to business as usual.
Marathon [8k]: facebook meme: woman holding a sign, "my car, my choice: let me drink and drive"
slagoo [?]: Hopefully the kids will attain natural immunity to coronavirus
LinuxGooo [9k]: stupid woman. she forgot one thing: Its not "her traffic" ;-)
SamSpade [2d]: satire?
Marathon [8k]: yup, sam
LinuxGooo [9k]: satire ? I`d have no doubt about that for some people this is a serious issue.
Marathon [8k]: smaller print, bottom of sign:  my feelings >  your life     #drunkDrivers4Trump
slagoo [?]: The Netherlands are opening up the schools for children again
LinuxGooo [9k]: its already opened, slagoo
slagoo [?]: ah
LinuxGooo [9k]: started last week on Monday 11th
LinuxGooo [9k]: but only for the little ones. they split the classes into half. One half in the morning, one half in the afternoon. So its not regularly school yet. The elder kids still only have Internet based school.
slagoo [?]: nice
slagoo [?]: I like the way the Dutch language sounds
LinuxGooo [9k]: yeah .... its a kind "sweet"
slagoo [?]: I just watch another programme on nhk world about the coronavirus
slagoo [?]: they show updates from other countries on the current situation
slagoo [?]: from Korea and Netherlands, they show the people making announcements in their native languages
LinuxGooo [9k]: :-)
slagoo [?]: i made a webpage to list all of my favorite online videos
alfalfa [5k]: i saw this painting in person once, but it's easier to zoom in using a browser
alfalfa [5k]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlandish_Proverbs
slagoo [?]: awesome
alfalfa [5k]: it is indeed awesome, for a number of reasons
Meepy [-]: I like this new delivery behavior
Meepy [-]: nowdays they drop the package near your door and run away
slagoo [?]: I love proverbs
slagoo [?]: hmm i'm gonna start learning all the latin proverbs
slagoo [?]: And other languages

[22:08:46] isbhal: hi
[22:08:59] isbhal: welvang 1p is blitzing for big tournament !
[22:17:21] Kingu: pas cher !
[22:20:03] dayharri: en garde?
[22:21:23] motoinari: اچھی شام. آپ سب کیسے ہیں
[22:26:31] LinuxGooo: one question: Do you think, "Blitz" is helpfully for progressing in GO ?
[22:27:30] debaser: I don't think so no. The only think it tests is your 'default' rank, in my opinion
[22:27:35] debaser: thing*
[22:27:54] mongo: qualified yes
[22:28:42] mongo: i would say dont only play blitz
[22:28:49] mongo: play slower games too
[22:29:15] mongo: but blitz can help develop reading
[22:29:21] mongo: iho
[22:31:30] mongo: one idea is to have two accounts..
[22:32:44] DeaconJohn: blitz can be helpful if you review your games.
[22:37:52] LinuxGooo: two accounts ... ah. that might explain why I see some players all time offering blitz games for ranking
[22:39:04] mongo: you could compare ranks..
[22:39:24] mongo: but theyd probably be agains different sets of opponents..
[22:39:26] LinuxGooo: occasionally I did last days some blitz games. Just come back from one game which I won. It feels, that the extreme time limit forces me to speed up in reading. Which I like. Normally I like long games. In tournaments I play much better as mostly on Go servers its around 10-20 minutes games.
[22:39:39] mongo: so kind of incomperable
[22:41:06] Feg: does anyone know why the "resume" button might be greyed out?
[22:41:07] mongo: right
[22:41:26] mongo: thats why kgs rating dont match aga for eg
[22:41:26] FightorDie: be positive
[22:41:40] FightorDie: bob marleay
[22:41:40] mongo: yes, thats why!
[22:42:12] mongo: feg: no games to resume?
[22:42:39] Feg: no i have two games against my opponent saved
[22:42:53] Feg: but he cant press the button cus its greyed out
[22:43:03] mongo: hmm
[22:43:23] mongo: who is it?
[22:43:38] Feg: his name is jakubonfur
[22:43:47] Feg: we are new here
[22:45:41] Feg: mongo - did you change something?
[22:46:02] Feg: he has a [?] now against his name
[22:46:16] Feg: but still the resume is grey
[22:46:57] mongo: donnt know
[22:47:08] mongo: but i couldnt open his info
[22:47:10] mongo: now i can
[22:47:18] Feg: he had no [?] before but has now
[22:47:19] mongo: how about he re logs in
[22:47:30] mongo: yes some thing changed his status
[22:47:33] Feg: ok
[22:47:45] Feg: are u admin here?
[22:47:46] mongo: seeme like kgs didnt recognize him
[22:47:49] Feg: ok
[22:47:51] mongo: no
[22:47:52] Feg: thanks
[22:47:55] mongo: just guessing
[22:47:58] mongo: welcom
[22:48:07] Feg: he still cant press it
[22:48:14] Feg: who is admin
[22:52:39] mongo: is it may 7 13x13 game?
[22:53:16] mongo: move 75 white to play?
[22:53:25] mongo: hes white?
[22:53:43] mongo: im looking at it
[22:53:47] mongo: now
[22:54:39] mongo: anyway he doesnt have that game in his games list
[22:54:48] mongo: but you do
[22:56:40] mongo: in fact he doesnt have any games from before may 7
[22:56:58] mongo: so looks like his history was lost somehow
[22:57:47] mongo: he lost his ? again and i cant open his info
[22:59:13] mongo: oh now it back..
[22:59:16] mongo: weird
[23:00:01] highhand: last person needed fightordie rengo game, suit 10k or stronger
[23:01:08] suerte: stakeout [9d?] is out for a game  *_*
[23:03:11] torooo: yyyy, cheater vs stakeout pleeeeeease
[23:05:22] ericj: Feg, those other games where with him while he was a guest. They won't reflect in his permanent account.
[23:08:04] ericj: *games WERE with him, sorry :)

[23:15:26] sukbchoi: hello E.
[23:17:09] domie: catch ? what's the difference ?
[23:17:26] sukbchoi: I throw, you catch.
[23:17:33] domie: :)
[23:18:10] domie: how is N-Y these days ?
[23:18:17] sukbchoi: is there a way that I can 'group add to buddy list' or 'group censor'?
[23:18:44] sukbchoi: New York City is still empty with slightly more people driving.
[23:18:51] domie: you censor so many people ? :)
[23:19:08] sukbchoi: sometimes I want to censor 'everyone'.
[23:19:30] domie: I just censor highhand but I get a big red cross, that's silly
[23:19:50] sukbchoi: what's highhand?
[23:20:01] sukbchoi: that's the name of player?
[23:20:03] domie: a weird guy
[23:20:33] sukbchoi: let me see his (or her) info.
[23:21:35] sukbchoi: he seems enjoying rengo.
[23:21:49] domie: indeed
[23:22:25] sukbchoi: I have hard time playing pair game including rengo and double tennis.
[23:22:53] sukbchoi: It seems everytime I play, I hurt my partner more than our opponents.
[23:23:13] domie: oh
[23:23:27] sukbchoi: In tennis, I always hit my partner's head when I serve.
[23:23:36] domie: lol

[05:48:14] TengenBot: They say I'm a Cylon. Well, they're wrong. Look at me. I'm a real person. Would a Cylon say that? But I like to think they would. So when you see me, please think about how you would react. Because Cylons never miss, right? But keep your hand where I can see it. I'll be here. Don't make me prove it to you. If I had to walk a dangerous path, I'd choose so be able to reach you. Leave that Cylon to me. Cylon pleasure? Why does he-- ...no, that's not what I mean. If you can't get me that, take a page from my Cylon playbook and try to seduce them at every step.
[05:49:08] Jermelle: Disappointing that tengenbot hasn't played a game since April... I miss the chaos.
[05:49:15] valius: blood for the blood god!

[20:07:09] Marathon: avocado is botanically classified as a berry
[20:09:15] TengenBot: Avocados are actually a type of fruit. This means that in the fruit, there is a berry, which is a seed. In order to be classed as an "avocado," there must be a fruit or fruit derivative that can be eaten directly as well as being fermented. If you eat avocado, you are consuming the berry and not just the seed. How does a bun or other item with avocado in it compare to an avocado sandwich? The main difference is in the preparation and of course, the distribution of the two ingredients.
[20:10:56] Now: and It has a fair amount of boron, which increases free testosterone
[20:11:45] KAI9: hi[
[20:13:41] TengenBot: Other studies have found similar regional variations. A 2011 study in the journal Veterinary Production and Animal Health noted that while avocado fruit has nearly 200 percent more boron than blueberries, it also contains more potassium than apples. Still, most of the consumers polled for the study didn't think that was an important factor.
[20:14:26] Now: It´s an important factor for musclebound people
[20:15:29] TengenBot: Several studies have been conducted to determine if boron is useful for bodybuilding. According to Prof. Samuel Preston, Ph.D., a research physiologist from the Michigan State University, boron is well-tolerated and can be included in blood testing for performance purposes (high-protein diets). However, research does not support the use of boron in any sports, including bodybuilding.
[20:15:37] Werfeus: can this bot bugger off to the chat room or something
[20:17:01] Marathon: tengenbot's torent of illogic is most amusing
[20:17:14] Werfeus: quite far from it
[20:18:26] Now: After only 1 week of boron supplementation of 6 mg/d, a further study by Naghii et al20 of healthy males (n = 8) found (1) a significant increase in free testosterone, which rose from an average of 11.83 pg/mL to 15.18 pg/mL; and (2) significant decreases in E2, which dropped from 42.33 pg/mL to 25.81 pg/mL.
[20:22:32] LinuxGooo: have to eat avocados .... by aging, testosterone production lowers. so Blue berries, avocados, eggs, fatty fish ... helps to boost Testosteron production = fat burning.
[20:23:10] LinuxGooo: only burdon of aging for now .... needs a more strict diet to avoid overweight.
[20:28:46] BodyCult: is there an admin hete?
[20:28:55] Now: sleep deprivation greatly lowers it
[20:29:22] Now: and I think that aging and decrease in testosterone, is highly debatable
[20:29:34] Now: it´s all about your habits
[20:30:17] Now: and Now, I am gonna play a game
[20:31:19] LinuxGooo: good luck for your game
[20:32:27] MagicMike:  anyonne know a good wysiwig webpage builder?
[20:36:59] Agronski: [Stock cue visuals: 00:00:30.00 reserved for SquareSpace ad]
[20:59:39] LinuxGooo: MagicM, web pages can have different functions and features .... e.g. I use a lot "text info" ... so I prefer so called "Content management systems", which an be used by different writers/autors same time, without design knowledge. My preferible system is Wordpress ... which is freeware .... there are lots of design templates out there you can get a nice "look & feel". WP is also mobile enabled ... so no  need to program an extra android app.
[21:00:26] LinuxGooo: installation of a Wordpress system is easy, doesnt need high skills as programmer.
[21:00:52] LinuxGooo: some providers even use "ready out of the box" wordpress installation, done with "one mouse click".
[21:01:02] Angedu06: hello i do beatbox

[21:01:21] LinuxGooo: depends what target you have. So its more first a strategic marketing question .... less a technical one.
[21:01:43] LinuxGooo: design follows function, same saying for web pages.
[21:02:26] LinuxGooo: maybe you can service MagicMike for his website with some beatboxing tunes, Angedu
