00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:28.840
It's been two decades since Jack and Rose's ill-fated romance broke our hearts and turned "never let go" into the most romantic vow one could make.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.400
At the time of filming, Titanic was the most expensive movie ever made, and no one could have predicted the monstrous success headed its way.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:47.640
But even after dissecting the film, its stars, and the real-life events that inspired it, there are still some things about the movie that remain endlessly fascinating.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.080
It`s Julia, you are watching HOW THEY CHANGED and now I`ll tell you some interesting facts about Titanic.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.120
During production, the movie was called Planet Ice.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.360
Director James Cameron used a decoy title in case other studios were making films about the RMS Titanic.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:19.120
Clever? Yes, but the fake title didn't stop Leonardo DiCaprio fans from congregating near the gates of Fox Baja Studios in Mexico during filming.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.080
Madonna was considered for the role of Rose.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.560
It would have been a great follow-up to 1996's Evita, which earned Madonna a Golden Globe for Best Actress.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.560
But thanks to 19-year-old Winslet's persistence, she was the only one who ended up with a winning ticket.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.760
“I closed the script, wept floods of tears and said, ‘Right, I’ve absolutely got to be a part of this. No two ways about it,’.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.880
To further prove she was the only person for the job, Winslet sent Cameron a small gift.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.920
It was a rose! A rose for Rose! Winslet also wrote "a note that basically said, 'I'm ready.'

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.200
Gloria Stuart was the only Titanic cast member who was alive during Titanic’s maiden voyage in 1912.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.840
Stuart was almost 2 when the RMS Titanic perished in the Atlantic

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:35.200
In 1998, she also became the oldest Academy Award nominee at 87 when she was up for Best Supporting Actress.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.360
DiCaprio was "like a cat” on set, according to Cameron, who said DiCaprio “always made this big drama about getting wet.”

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.960
Eventually, he warmed up, quite literally, thanks to the crew members who poured buckets of warm water over the actor over months of filming.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.000
It cost more to make Titanic the movie than Titanic the ship.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:22.160
Cameron and company spent $200 million to make the film in 1997, while the ship cost $7.5 million.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.240
That number would be $180 million after adjusted inflation.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.080
Rose stared at an incorrect star field in the film's original release.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.320
Towards the end of the movie, a near-frozen Rose sees a sparkly night sky as Jack makes his way to the frozen afterlife.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:00.960
Unfortunately, that's not what a real Titanic survivor would have seen given the coordinates in the water, according to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:14.880
Ahead of the film’s 15-year re-release in 2012, Cameron adjusted it and revealed that Tyson sent him a “snarky e-mail” pointing out the error.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.320
“And with my reputation as a perfectionist, I should have known that and I should have put the right star field in," said Cameron.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.240
"So I said, ‘All right, send me the right stars for the exact time and I’ll put it in the movie.’”

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.600
Those are not DiCaprio’s hands drawing Rose.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:45.640
As Titanic fans know, Cameron was the skilled artist behind Jack's drawing of Rose wearing nothing but the Heart of the Ocean.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.160
In 2011, the drawing sold for “at least $16,000” in an auction.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.960
Near the end of the shoot, about 50 members of the cast and crew were sent to the hospital after eating spiked chowder.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.680
80 people were sent to the hospital with hallucinations.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:23.640
It happened just after midnight on Aug. 9, 1996 in Dartmouth, someone had laced the lobster chowder with PCP or angel dust.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.760
The case inspired several conspiracy theories, including one involving an angry chef that had been let go.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.600
The piece of wooden paneling that Rose floated on after the sinking is based upon

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:55.400
a genuine artifact that survived the sinking and is on display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.960
Titanic was the first film James Cameron ever directed that did not include or mention nuclear weapons.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.840
Thanks for watching! Stay awesome and take care friends.
