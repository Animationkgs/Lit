00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.920
Did you know, that the majority of the budget was spent on music

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.640
and despite the show being about life in Michigan it was shot in California?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.680
Hi, its Alex and are watching HOW THEY CHANGED.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.040
It's been more than a decade since NBC's Freaks and Geeks graced the small screen, but it certainly doesn't feel like it.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.840
but it certainly doesn't feel like it.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.480
The series ran for 18 episodes, but the finale wasn't shot last.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.760
"We shot the finale halfway through the season," - Jason Segel shared.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.880
Creator Paul Feig noted that Freaks and Geeks, which featured a young cast - some of whom hadn't gone through puberty yet -

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.320
was NBC's lowest-rated show when it aired. It drew 7 million viewers, Feig said,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.160
and a hit today pulls in 8 million.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.680
Cast member John Francis Daley, was 13 years old when he filmed Freaks and Geeks and appropriately, he experienced his first onscreen kiss.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.360
"First onscreen erection too, but no one talks about that," Daley commented.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.760
Busy Philipps had her first onscreen kiss with Franco too.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:48.920
The show spent a large portion of its budget for the rights on music from the The Who, Van Halen, Rush, Styx, The Grateful Dead, The Moody Blues, and Billy Joel,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.480
and when it came to re-airing the show on Fox Family, that network substituted cheaper songs.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.640
However, Feig and Apatow waited until they found a distributor (Shout! Factory)

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.320
willing to pony up for the rights to the original songs before they’d release it on DVD.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.960
Freaks and Geeks essentially kept several of the cast members out of college.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.480
Jason Segel decided not to go to college to act on Freaks and Geeks;

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.720
Seth Rogen dropped out of high school (although, he lied and said he was doing correspondance school, when in fact he was writing Superbad);

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.320
and Busy Phillips and Linda Cardellini both dropped out of college.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:43.680
In attempt at keeping the show “real” Apatow and Feig sat down Linda Cardellini and Busy Phillips for an awkward conversation about body image and their characters;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:53.600
both suggesting that neither actor lose any weight like many TV actresses do, because they wanted the pair to look like real high school kids.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.720
Fun fact: Linda and Busy share a birthday, June 25th (only Linda was born in 1975 and Busy in 1979).

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.240
If you watch the theme song closely,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.640
you’ll notice that Jason Segel was in the background of Seth Rogen’s shot rubbing his eyes.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.600
He was doing so to give the impression that he looked high.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:27.320
As a favor to Judd Apatow, Ben Stiller agreed to appear in the 17th episode in an attempt to help Freaks and Geeks avoid cancellation.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.960
By the time the episode aired, the show had already been axed.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.480
James Franco and Busy Phillips, despite being a couple on the show, reportedly disliked each other in real life.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.920
Part of that tension apparently stemmed from a scene in which Franco — who had developed a his own backstory about coming from an abused family,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.400
without telling Busy Phillips — pushed Busy to the ground as part of his “method” acting.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.480
Not expecting to be pushed, it knocked the wind out of Phillips, and she ran to her trailer crying.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.360
Franco apparently had a habit of improvising on set,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.600
and sometimes, not to great effect (such as improvising a scene in which he threw milk in a character’s face).

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.720
Fans of Freaks and Geeks know that the show takes place in a fictional suburb of Detroit - Chippewa, Michigan.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.560
The show wasn’t filmed anywhere near its implied setting.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.160
It was filmed in sunny California.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.760
The camera crew used grey and green tinted lights to achieve the natural coloring in a Midwestern area,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.760
and they tried to avoid shooting outside whenever they could.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.840
The pilot of the show was filmed in a real school,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.000
however when the show was picked up by the network they built sets to match the original pilot school,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.080
filming the rest of the season on the school sets.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.120
The primary school set was simply just one “T” section of a hallway,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.080
which was constantly changed, altered and redressed to make it feel like different sections of the school.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.440
The extras walking down the hall would need to wait at the end of the hallway quietly

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.920
each time they walked by the camera since there was nowhere for them to go that wouldn’t cross the camera’s path.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.800
That’s all for this time, friends!
