(Rex Harrison) Miss Audrey Hepburn

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:15.210
[Applause]

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:18.319
[Music]

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.319
[Applause]

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.059
[Music]

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:35.390
[Applause]

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:40.100
If all the world's a stage and all the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.850
men and women merely players, then here is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:49.339
a very special player who has also been

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:54.220
our friend. For what is friendship if not

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:59.600
a willingness to give, to give laughter

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:07.550
where there are tears, comfort when there are

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:11.810
fears, pleasure, fantasy and fun where there

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:16.369
is none. For young and old to create a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.640
world they may never see peopled with

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:25.270
characters and clowns they will never be.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:31.520
A friend who brings to our lives often

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:35.720
stark, brightness and cheer sweeping away

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.270
thoughts sorrowful and dark giving us

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.610
strength to face each day and come what

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.759
may, we know he will be there to help us

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:50.569
bear our lives as if it were a play. So

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.709
thank you, Cary, for giving joy across

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:58.429
the years to those who need in times of

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:03.340
selfishness and greed a star to hang

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:09.530
their dreams on. And before I'm gone, in

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.130
gratitude and love I end, you have truly

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.880
been a friend.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.150
[Applause]

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.150
[Music]

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.909
[Applause]
