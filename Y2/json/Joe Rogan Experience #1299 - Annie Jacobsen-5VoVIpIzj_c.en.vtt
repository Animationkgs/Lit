00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.020 align:start position:0%
program so he had like a burden to

end of what we did they go I wish they
were<00:18:12.040><c> aliens</c><00:18:12.300><c> hmm</c>

another planet is that what they did a

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.430 align:start position:0%
mothership mm-hmm
 

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
mothership mm-hmm
in<00:18:42.520><c> those</c><00:18:42.730><c> days</c><00:18:42.970><c> drones</c><00:18:43.750><c> were</c><00:18:44.320><c> there</c><00:18:45.100><c> was</c><00:18:45.220><c> a</c>

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.250 align:start position:0%
in those days drones were there was a
 

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
in those days drones were there was a

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:46.690 align:start position:0%
mothership and a drone was attached to
 

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.770 align:start position:0%
mothership and a drone was attached to
it<00:18:46.900><c> and</c><00:18:46.990><c> it</c><00:18:47.080><c> was</c><00:18:47.170><c> jettisoned</c><00:18:47.470><c> off</c><00:18:48.030><c> okay</c><00:18:49.030><c> mm-hmm</c>

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:49.780 align:start position:0%
it and it was jettisoned off okay mm-hmm
 

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:56.310 align:start position:0%
it and it was jettisoned off okay mm-hmm
so<00:18:50.100><c> in</c><00:18:51.100><c> those</c><00:18:51.280><c> days</c><00:18:51.610><c> well</c><00:18:52.060><c> in</c><00:18:53.190><c> 1947-48</c><00:18:55.320><c> well</c>

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
so in those days well in 1947-48 well
 

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.330 align:start position:0%
so in those days well in 1947-48 well
they<00:18:56.410><c> didn't</c><00:18:56.650><c> I</c><00:18:56.770><c> mean</c><00:18:56.890><c> that</c><00:18:57.040><c> was</c><00:18:57.160><c> drone</c>

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:57.340 align:start position:0%
they didn't I mean that was drone
 

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.130 align:start position:0%
they didn't I mean that was drone
technology<00:18:57.520><c> then</c><00:18:58.090><c> okay</c><00:18:58.600><c> right</c><00:18:58.780><c> so</c><00:18:58.840><c> there's</c><00:18:59.080><c> a</c>

00:18:59.130 --> 00:18:59.140 align:start position:0%
technology then okay right so there's a
 

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.650 align:start position:0%
technology then okay right so there's a
mother<00:18:59.290><c> a</c><00:18:59.560><c> mother</c><00:18:59.620><c> craft</c><00:19:00.250><c> like</c><00:19:01.000><c> her</c><00:19:01.090><c> aircraft</c>

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:01.660 align:start position:0%
mother a mother craft like her aircraft
 

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
mother a mother craft like her aircraft
and<00:19:02.050><c> then</c><00:19:02.230><c> the</c><00:19:02.470><c> drone</c><00:19:02.740><c> is</c><00:19:02.980><c> like</c><00:19:03.160><c> a</c><00:19:03.190><c> small</c>

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:03.550 align:start position:0%
and then the drone is like a small
 

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
and then the drone is like a small
aircraft<00:19:05.070><c> under</c><00:19:06.070><c> it</c><00:19:06.220><c> and</c><00:19:06.430><c> it</c><00:19:06.610><c> gets</c><00:19:06.700><c> jettisoned</c>

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:07.390 align:start position:0%
aircraft under it and it gets jettisoned
 

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.230 align:start position:0%
aircraft under it and it gets jettisoned
off<00:19:07.600><c> and</c><00:19:08.160><c> that</c><00:19:09.160><c> was</c><00:19:09.370><c> what</c><00:19:09.550><c> the</c><00:19:09.670><c> craft</c><00:19:09.880><c> was</c><00:19:10.120><c> it</c>

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
off and that was what the craft was it
 

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
off and that was what the craft was it
was<00:19:10.360><c> jettisoned</c><00:19:10.630><c> off</c><00:19:11.170><c> so</c><00:19:11.440><c> that</c><00:19:11.590><c> so</c><00:19:11.920><c> stolen</c>

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:12.310 align:start position:0%
was jettisoned off so that so stolen
 

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.130 align:start position:0%
was jettisoned off so that so stolen
