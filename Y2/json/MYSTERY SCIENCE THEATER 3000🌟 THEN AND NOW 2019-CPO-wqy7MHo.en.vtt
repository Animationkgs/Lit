00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:30.020
Did you know that Mystery Science Theater 3000 has been cancelled four times and Joel Robinson doesn't sleep much during the process of filming the series?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.020
Hi, it`s Alex and you are watching HOW THEY CHANGED.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.060
Three decades, a smartass janitor and some robots riffed on bad movies â€” and kicked off a sarcasm-comedy revolution

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.240
In the not too distant past - a moderately successful stand-up comedian named Joel Hodgson slipped on a jumpsuit.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.800
He then spent a few hours on a Minneapolis UHF station making fun of the terrible movies

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.880
Invaders from the Deep and Revenge of the Mysterions from Mars, alongside a couple of handmade robot puppets.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.740
Only a handful of lucky Minnesotans were watching KTMA that Thanksgiving night, 30 years ago.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.560
They all saw the birth of a pop culture phenomenon: a charmingly cheap-looking show that, no joke, changed television.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.460
Joel Robinson doesn`t sleep much.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:45.180
While some viewers assumed he was high, and most others didn't think too much about it at all, it turns out Joel just needed a nap.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.060
When the original Mystery Science Theater 3000 pilot was recorded for KTMA,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:01.960
Joel Hodgson had been awake for four days straight getting things ready -- building props and sets, writing skits, basically creating the entire show from scratch.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.760
By the time the cameras rolled, Joel the actor was running on nothing but caffeine and determination.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.660
There were only two guest stars.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.840
Mystery Science Theater 3000 has been a cult favorite, basically from day one.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.860
That doesn't mean the show didn't have its celebrity fans, though.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.640
But while many viewers fondly remember Adam West and others guest-starring on the show, they didn't actually.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.500
West was one of many guests brought on during the bumpers for the Turkey Day marathons.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.200
The show proper only had two guest stars: Leonard Maltin and Minnesota Viking Robert Smith.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.660
And thatâ€™s all interesting facts about Mystery Science Theater 3000 for now.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.200
Hope you enjoyed this small review.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.600
Next episodes are coming soon.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.480
