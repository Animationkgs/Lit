so<01:05:27.220><c> he's</c><01:05:27.339><c> showing</c><01:05:27.369><c> arrows</c><01:05:28.060><c> in</c><01:05:28.210><c> the</c><01:05:28.300><c> quiver</c>

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:28.450 align:start position:0%
so he's showing arrows in the quiver
 

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
so he's showing arrows in the quiver
versus<01:05:29.050><c> arrows</c><01:05:29.380><c> in</c><01:05:29.500><c> his</c><01:05:29.589><c> hand</c><01:05:29.920><c> how</c><01:05:30.130><c> he</c><01:05:30.190><c> can</c>

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:30.369 align:start position:0%
versus arrows in his hand how he can
 

01:05:30.369 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%

came pretty close last summer to doing
 

01:08:56.259 --> 01:08:58.349 align:start position:0%
came pretty close last summer to doing

this but the budget was too high and the
 

01:08:58.359 --> 01:08:59.729 align:start position:0%
this but the budget was too high and the
budget<01:08:58.660><c> was</c><01:08:58.779><c> so</c><01:08:58.930><c> high</c><01:08:59.109><c> I</c><01:08:59.140><c> think</c><01:08:59.290><c> that</c><01:08:59.589><c> they</c>

01:08:59.729 --> 01:08:59.739 align:start position:0%
budget was so high I think that they
 

01:08:59.739 --> 01:09:01.019 align:start position:0%

01:09:01.019 --> 01:09:01.029 align:start position:0%
thought that the only way they could
 

01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:02.309 align:start position:0%
thought that the only way they could

01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
make their money back as if they had
 

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.559 align:start position:0%

01:09:04.559 --> 01:09:04.569 align:start position:0%
Batman or Wonder Woman in it but that
 

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:08.490 align:start position:0%
