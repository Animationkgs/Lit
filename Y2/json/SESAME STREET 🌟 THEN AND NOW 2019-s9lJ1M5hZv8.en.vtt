Hello friends, it`s Alex and you are watching HOW THEY CHANGED, and it means, that today you will learn something new about wonderful Sesame street.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.720
As always, while you will watch, how the main voice actors has changed thru years, I will tell you some interesting facts about the show.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.840
I must say, that there are a lot of characters left in this video, but if you want, I will make part two, write in comments, what you think about it.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.040
And now hit a like, and lets begin.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:06.880
In its almost 45-year history, “Sesame Street” has won 159 Emmys, multiple Grammys and over three dozen countries have a version and many more air the dubbed American show.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.800
In short, millions of people the world over have discovered how to get to Sesame Street.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.400
“Sesame Street” is named after the “Arabian Nights” phrase “Open, Sesame!”.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.000
One of the show writers proposed the word “Sesame.”

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.560
Its use in an “Arabian Nights” tale, she said, made it feel like it was loaded with a sense of adventure.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.840
The show was already set on an urban street, so “Sesame Street” just clicked.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:45.840
Everyone on the staff initially disliked the name, fearing children would have a hard time pronouncing it, but obviously those worries ended up being put to rest.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.840
The Count’s love of numbers isn’t exactly just a play on his name.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.600
Vampires are supposed to have arithmomania — a strong need to count surrounding objects.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:08.640
In some versions of vampire folklore, a way to ward off the attacker is to throw “rice, millet or wheat,” as the bloodsucker will need to count the grains before moving on.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.360
In Europe, people would place “poppy seeds, millet or sand” at the graves of suspected vampires as a pre-emptive defense.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.760
Bert and Ernie could have been the main stars.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:33.440
The original pilot featured many scenes with Bert and Ernie, and they tested well with kids as compared to the scenes which only featured adults.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.480
This lead to the decision to either have the show only focus on the roommates, or create new characters like Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.600
The producers chose the latter option.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.040
The Elmo puppet was initially just a background extra and was given up on as a workable character.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:05.040
Elmo didn’t officially debut until Season 12, although the muppet had already been used as a random extra in scenes for quite some time.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.720
Initially this “new” character only communicated with “sounds rather than words.”

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:21.680
Apparently, one of the early voices of the character, Richard Hunt, tried to perform Elmo with a gruff, caveman voice, but eventually abandoned the concept.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.200
According to legend, he tossed Elmo around, only to have Kevin Clash pick up the muppet and create the beloved character.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:42.560
The red 3-year-old ended up becoming the only puppet or non-human to testify before Congress in 2002, advocating for increased funding for music programs.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.360
Oscar the Grouch actually fell in love ... with the Wicked Witch of the West.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.800
The trashcan dweller may be known for usually just loving “crummy weather,” but he has actually fallen in love.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:06.880
In a now banned episode that was deemed too scary for children, the Wicked Witch of the West made an appearance on “Sesame Street” and was crushed on by Oscar.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.080
Unfortunately, the relationship didn’t take off.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.280
The show pays homage to 'M*A*S*H'

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.960
Big Bird has a teddy bear named Radar, a tribute to the M*A*S*H character of the same name, who always sleeps with a teddy bear.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.320
All Sesame Street's main Muppets have four fingers except Cookie Monster, who has five.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:49.920
And Cookie Monster evolved from The Wheel-Stealer—a snack-pilfering puppet Jim Henson created to promote Wheels, Crowns and Flutes in the 1960s.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.320
That’s about all for now.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:06.480
As you may see, I gradually increase the time of the video, because I have a lot of interesting information that I want to share with you, hope you will enjoy it.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.560
Take care, friends, and have a great day, or may be night, if you are watching this video at night.
