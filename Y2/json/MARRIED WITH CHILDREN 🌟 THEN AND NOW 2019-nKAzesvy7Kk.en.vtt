Hello! My name is Julia and you are watching HOW THEY CHANGED. Today we will talk about Married... with Children.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:37.440
Former Laverne &amp; Shirley and Diff’rent Strokes writers Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt were tired of the saccharine family sitcoms of the '80s.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:51.040
So when given the opportunity to create a brand-new show for the then-brand-new Fox network, the two conceived of a series that went against everything they'd been working on up until then.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.640
What began with a working title of “Not the Cosbys” became Married... with Children.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:06.880
The show received a boost in popularity shortly after it first came out in 1987, but from an unexpected source.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:20.240
That boost largely came from a family values activist who started a letter campaign complaining about the show’s subject matter, arguing that it was promoting an anti-family narrative.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.120
The story caught the media’s attention and shined a spotlight on the show, putting Fox on the map once and for all.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.720
Married… with Children was Fox Broadcasting Company’s very first prime-time television series, and it was an absolute hit.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.640
If the Internet was a huge thing back in 1987, the sitcom would have been an overnight viral sensation.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:02.640
In fact, the very first episode, which aired on April 15, 1987, had so many viewers that Fox played it over and over again that same night.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:13.200
But there would be something unexpected that would propel this show about the  dysfunctional Bundy family to even more success than was anticipated.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.960
Married… with Children‘s star Ed O’Neill is apparently a jack of all trades.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.480
When he isn’t acting, O’Neill spends his time training in Brazilian Jiujitsu.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.720
That’s right, Al Bundy can most likely kick your butt in a fist fight!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.200
O’Neill was introduced to the sport by his friend, writer and director John Milius.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.920
He has trained in the martial art for more than 20 years, and received his black belt in 2007.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.320
He considers the black belt the greatest achievement of his life, apart from his children.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:03.400
If you’ve watched this TV show, you’ve seen the shot of cars driving through the interstate interchange in the opening credits.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.960
But the shot isn’t an original one. In fact, it comes from a tremendously famous movie from a few years earlier.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.520
The shot from the show’s opening sequence was pulled from 1983’s National Lampoon’s Vacation.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:33.440
If you look closely, you can’t miss the Griswold family’s iconic green and brown Ford Crown Victoria (Wagon Queen Family Truckster) station wagon.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.080
Ed O’Neill’s character in Married… with Children is more than just notoriously cheap – he has become a sitcom legend.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.880
But there’s another ’90s sitcom star who could have played Al Bundy.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.040
That man is Michael Richards.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:02.320
Richards, who played the iconic Cosmo Kramer in Seinfeld, auditioned for the role of Al Bundy during casting for the show in 1986.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.760
Casting director Marc Hirschfeld said Richards just “wasn’t right for Al Bundy.”

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.920
When Hirschfeld was casting for Seinfeld, though, he remembered Richards.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.160
That’s how he became Kramer.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.320
When Katey Sagal auditioned to play Peggy Bundy, she really, really wanted the role.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.440
Sagal wanted to go above and beyond killing the audition.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.800
She intended to get into character and prove she even looked the way Peggy was meant to look.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.040
Sagal had a pre-notion of what exactly that look was: an attractive woman with fair skin and huge, red hair.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.120
So she showed up to the audition wearing a poofy wig and captivated the casting directors.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.080
Ed O'Neill found out about the show's cancellation while on vacation.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.560
He overheard a couple talking about the newspaper article announcing the end of the show.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.440
He bought them a meal to thank them for the information.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.080
Do Vista Cards Exist? The answer is no.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.040
Visa cards exist, yes, but good luck trying to pay for your groceries with a Vista card.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:32.000
Vista cards do exist in Married… with Children, though, and the famous sign displayed in Al Bundy’s shoe shop actually reads “VISTA” cards.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.960
