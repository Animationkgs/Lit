00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.790
Ever since man figured out written language,
we’ve been finding more and more efficient

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.790
ways of storing information on different types
of media.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.790
In this episode I’m going to be showing
you a whole bunch of rare and bizarre media

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.630
types. Now, I have a lot of them to cover
so I’m not going to spend a whole lot of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.540
time on any one particular media. But, I have
separated it up into three different categories.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.200
For example, I’m going to have category
on mechanical media, so this is media that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.801
requires something physically to touch and
move in order to read the information. And

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:45.460
of course, I’m going to cover magnetic media,
which of course works with magnets to read

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.630
the information. And then I’ll move into
optical media, which uses lasers typically

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.480
to read the media. Now, I won’t really be
talking about any modern flash memory or anything

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.379
like that. But also, because there are so
many of these, I’m going to put a little

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.350
bit of a table of contents down in the description
field, so if there’s a particular type of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.070
media you want to look for, you can find out
exactly what time stamp to go to to see that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.630
kind of media. So, let’s get started.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.729
We’ll start with one of the oldest media
types, an Edison cylinder. While, based on

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.840
the original wax cylinder, this is a slightly
newer design that is made of plastic, and

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.219
was probably made in the very early 1900s,
which means it is still over 100 years old.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.390
These hold around 4 minutes of audio. The
inside appears to be a thick cardboard or

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.299
wood of some kind. Here’s a little closer
look at the grooves. Oh, and the actual artist

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.630
or song name was printed here on the edge
so you could read it if these were stacked

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.920
on a shelf.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.500
Now for something just a bit more modern.
This is a long-play microgroove record. This

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.020
was sort of revolutionary as it would hold
over 20 minutes of decent sounding audio per

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.409
side. This came out in the 1940s.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:01.299
And here’s something interesting for you.
3 channel stereophonic high fidelity by Motorola.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.272
I’m not quite sure how it works, but I think
you need a special Motorola record player

00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:09.220
to be able to use it. I think this came out
in the 1960s.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.400
And here’s something from a little earlier.
This is a victrola record, but it is just

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.640
single sided, which is apparently somewhat
rare. Notice that this one is just completely

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.430
smooth and flat on the back. Apparently, this
made them prone to cracking, so later on they

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.959
started stamping the Victor logo on the back
of them. And this is just a pattern to make

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.799
it stronger. Later on, they started putting
content on both sides of the disc.

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.370
Next we have an Edison diamond disc. These
came out around 1912 and were meant to compete

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.470
with the Victor standard, But instead of the
phonograph needle moving side to side, the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.040
diamond disk has the grooves designed so the
needle moves up and down, much like in the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.830
cylinders. One really noticeable thing about
these is that they are very thick, and kind

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.239
of heavy as compared to other records of the
era.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:06.390
OK, so what I have here is a 16 inch vinyl
record. And just as a size comparison, here’s

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.849
a 12 inch. And, yeah, you can see how much
bigger they are. So, you might ask, what on

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.569
earth kind of player would you even play something
like this in? Well, They were actually used

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.569
by radio stations. A lot of the material was
sent to radio stations to be played over the

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.939
air on these big 16 inch vinyl records because
they could hold a lot of audio. So, yeah if

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.019
you were listening to the radio back in the
1930s or 40s, you might very well have been

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.250
listening to the radio off of one of these.
So the radio stations had their own proprietary

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.439
players to play these discs.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.500
This particular one is apparently full of
radio commercials for Winston cigarettes.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.520
And this one here is from the United Nations
and is called Jungle Story. Flip around to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.519
the back and there’s something called “Blood
Brothers.”

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.370
And here’s another sort of mechanical contact
media. These are punch cards. Believe it or

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.049
not this format dates back to the 1920s before
computers, as a way to control certain mechanical

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.310
devices. But, the widest use was certainly
in early computer storage.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.690
But, this was later replaced by punch tape.
This is designed for binary storage, with

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.840
9 bits of data, one for parity checking, and
could come in large rolls to store larger

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.320
computer programs. The smaller little holes
down the middle were used for feeding and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.140
keeping track of which row of bits were being
read.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.601
And since we’re talking about computers
now, this is the last mechanical media I’m

00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:30.030
going to show. This was a computer magazine
and it was printed in 1978. It contains lots

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.510
of advertising and articles about computers
of the era, mostly Apple II stuff. But what’s

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.881
interesting is when you get to the middle
here, there is a little flexible record. This

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:42.660
is called The Floppy ROM and apparently it
contains several Apple II programs written

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.670
in BASIC. This was designed to play in your
record player and you could connect it to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.260
the cassette input on the back of your Apple
II and load just like it was from a cassette.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.830
It looks like there are at least 7 different
programs on this side, plus maybe 3 more on

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.800
the back side. I’ve never actually tried
this, but if enough people are interested,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.290
I might do a video on this product! But, time
to move on to magnetic media!

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.680
To get started, I have here an unopened box
of 8 inch floppy disks and two unusual boxes

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.620
of 5 and a quarter inch floppy discs, which
I’m going to unbox. I’ll start with the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:25.430
8 inch box here. Ohh.. I smell 1980s air in
there! Heck, that might even be 1970s air!

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.330
Anyway, so here are the large, original floppy
disks. These are the same kind of disks that

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.760
were used in the movie WarGames.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.810
Now, let’s open these 5 and a quarter inch
disks. I said they were unusual, but that’s

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.340
only partially true. These are 500 K floppy
disks. See, it says so right on the label.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.190
But they are also double-sided, double density
which means they are actually just regular

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.341
360K floppy disks. They are just showing the
raw, unformatted capacity on the label, which

00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:59.470
was an unusual and somewhat deceiving practice.
So, other than the label, there is nothing

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.470
unusual about these.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.740
These disks, on the other hand, do have something
different about them. These are called hard-sectored

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.900
disks. But what makes them different? Well,
they, look exactly the same. In fact, looking

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.680
at it next to the normal disks, there is nothing
different to see. But the difference is somewhat

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.460
hidden from view. So, to show you what is
different, I’ll show you a dirty trick for

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.320
removing the media from these without using
any cutting tools. Of course, if you ever

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.360
do this, don’t expect the disk to ever read
again. And now, I’ll pull out the hard sectored

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.960
media. Do you see the difference now? Yep,
the regular disk has one hole for a single

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.130
rotation. But the hard sectored disk has a
hole for each sector so the drive is always

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.280
aware of when a new sector begins.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.750
And although these look ordinary as well,
these are a bit rare. These are the quad-density

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.750
disks needed by some high capacity drives
used back in the early 1980s, like the Commodore

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.220
8050 and others.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.680
Moving along, this is an Apple Fileware disk,
sometimes called a Twiggy disk. These were

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.310
used in the original Apple Lisa, and were
intended to be used in the Macintosh, but

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.120
never were. Notice it has two areas for reading
the disk. That’s because the read heads

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.870
were on opposite sides of the disk, with a
foam pad on the opposite side from the read

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:19.310
head. Other than the weird shape, these are
similar in design to a 1.2 Megabyte high density

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.820
floppy, in fact it is possible to modify a
1.2 megabyte disk to work in a twiggy drive.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.550
As you can see, it is the same dimensions
as a regular floppy.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.940
This is a IBM prototype called the Demidiskette.
Apparently it is read diagonally from the

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.710
corner, which is weird. And just for size
comparison, here’s a regular 5 and a quarter

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.260
inch floppy disk. The final product actually
has a hard shell like this, but it was never

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.530
sold commercially.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.630
Here’s an interesting one. This is a 3 and
a quarter inch flex diskette. What makes this

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.810
interesting is it is like a hybrid of the
two most popular disk types. It’s in a flexible

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.490
jacket like the older style disks, but it
is smaller and uses a metal ring on the spindle

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:02.060
like later style disks. Here it is compared
to a regular floppy. And compared to a 3 and

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.810
a half. These were originally designed to
compete with the Sony 3 and a Half inch disk,

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.910
but virtually nobody used them.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:16.550
Here’s another little tiny disk. This was
used in some proprietary Brother sewing and

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.000
embroidery machines.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.550
This is a TEC floppy disk. Again, I have no
idea what it goes to. This one is also read

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.450
from the corner. And here it is compared to
a normal disk.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:39.550
And here is an Amsoft CF-2. These are hard
plastic disks. They are really stiff. And

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.459
they are a bit of an odd shape, as they are
sort of elongated. Here it is next to a 5

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:49.500
and a quarter. It’s closer in size to a
3 and a half. Here’s the write protect switch.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.510
And also, the disk material looks metallic,
which is weird.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:58.500
Moving along, this is an MCD cassette. Now,
don’t be fooled, this isn’t a tape, it’s

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.639
a disk, even though it is really thick and
heavy feeling. Here it is compared to a regular

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:06.620
floppy. You can see how much thicker it is.
And just in case you need proof that this

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.779
is a disk and not a tape, I’ll open the
little door here. No idea what these were

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:11.850
used for, though.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:17.589
OK, so here’s something really cool. These
two inch disks were used to store single NTSC

00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:23.199
frames of video in an analog format. There
are 50 tracks and each track stores one field.

00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:28.209
So you could store 25 complete frames on each
disk. These were used in the original Sony

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:32.740
Mavica camera, along with medical and industrial
equipment as a means to capture single photos

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.330
from endoscopes and other things. Here it
is compared to a regular floppy.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.800
Here’s a similar type floppy disk, but is
not compatible. It was only used by the Zenith

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.150
minisport laptop and they could hold 793 kilobytes
of data per disk, which was pretty cool at

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.800
the time, but these disks never gained any
market share.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.360
This one is called IT media. And while you
may be tempted to say it’s 1.44 megabytes,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.029
it’s actually missing the decimal point,
so it is 144 megabytes, 100 times what a similar

00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:06.840
sized floppy would store. This was a failed
competitor to the iOmega Zip disk, and the

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.759
LS-120 super floppy, which I don’t consider
either of these rare but if I didn’t show

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:16.050
them I’m get hounded with emails. So here
you go. This is the LS-120, which could store

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.750
120 megabytes per disk and the drives were
backwards compatible with floppies. This was

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.140
actually my favorite successor to the floppy
drive, but actually never caught on that much.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.710
Here it is compared with a regular floppy.
And of course the Zip disk, This one is 250

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.209
megabytes, but they came in other sizes. These
had a few years of great success, but were

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:37.390
killed off by recordable CDs.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.610
Here’s another very hyped, but failed disk
format. This is the Iomega Click disk. These

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.410
came out in the late 1990s and held 40 megabytes
of data. They were intended for digital cameras

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.801
and portable MP3 players, but with the price
drop of flash memory, they couldn’t compete

00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:56.230
by the time they came to market. They also
made a little PCMCIA card for your laptop

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.029
that was a tiny little drive that could read
and write to these like this. So, pretty neat.

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:04.740
And I think had flash media not became more
affordable, these would have probably been

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.800
a huge success.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:11.180
Ok, let’s move on to tape media. This is
one of those reel to reel computer tapes,

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.999
like the ones you might have seen in WarGames.
This format dates back to the 1950s and believe

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:20.950
it or not they were still in use by some companies
all the way up to around the year 2000. Now,

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.910
you would have to load these into a very similar
machine as would be used for reel to reel

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:29.430
audio tapes, or motion pictures, where they
would spool onto another reel during use.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.759
And here’s another brand, this one by 3M.
This one opens a little different. For this

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:39.149
one, you lift here, and then the outer protective
ring comes off. These probably took less room

00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:40.970
to store.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.860
Speaking of reels. I guess I’ll need to
show some audio reels, even though these aren’t

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.279
really that uncommon. There were many different
sizes. If you want to know more about these,

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:52.959
Techmoan has done numerous videos on the format.
This particular one is a motion picture soundtrack

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:57.579
to the movie Mondo Cane. And here’s a smaller
spool for home recording.

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:02.660
OK, let’s have a look at some video cassettes.
This type of cassette is known as U-Matic.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.410
It was used for broadcast material as it had
a higher resolution than VHS. This one says

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.170
I.R.S. on it. I’m not sure if this is some
kind of band, or some kind of documentary

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.600
about the internal revenue service. Anyway,
these tapes were used in TV stations to broadcast

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.870
regular content.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:22.649
Now, this one is even more interesting. It
says A-Team sales presentation. So, what this

00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:27.559
was, essentially, was a sales pitch of the
TV show the A-Team, which was sent out to

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:31.380
TV stations trying to get them to buy the
show. I’d love to get a U-Matic player and

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.889
have a look at what is on here. Maybe we’ll
do that in a future episode. Notice that the

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:40.550
spindles don’t look anything like VHS either
as there is no gear-like grooves.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:46.249
Here’s some history for you. This appears
to be a VHS version of the Shining. In fact,

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:50.650
it even says VHS right there. But, if you
open it up, you’ll find it’s actually

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:56.089
a beta-max tape. So, during the decline of
beta-max, they would reuse the same VHS cases

00:12:56.089 --> 00:13:00.720
to save money, but the shrink-wrap would have
a sticker on it saying it was betamax. But

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.360
yeah, this is an ordinary beta-max tape. Here
it is compared to a VHS tape. But now, I need

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.490
to show you the KING of cassettes.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:15.649
So, do you remember that scene from the movie
Crocodile Dundee? It goes something like this.

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:24.120
That’s not a knife. That’s a knife. So,
yeah, a good analogy for that would be for

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.670
someone to hold up a cassette like this and
say “I’ve got a cassette.” And then

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:35.730
you would say “well that’s not a cassette.
This is a cassette! So yeah, this mammoth

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.709
cassette comes in its own little suitcase
carrying case. Let’s open this thing up!

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:45.540
This is the Sony SD1 cassette. It is the biggest
cassette I’ve ever seen. This thing is huge!

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:52.480
Yeah, now that’s what I call a cassette!

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.379
Other than it is called the Sony SD-1, that’s
about all I know about it. I haven’t been

00:13:56.379 --> 00:14:00.149
able to find much of any information as to
what this giant cassette was actually used

00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:04.139
for. Although I do know it stored digital
information, since it is written right on

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:08.860
the cassette. Just for size comparison, here
is a traditional audio cassette. And even

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:14.230
a traditional video cassette is small by comparison.
This appears to be the write-protect option.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.629
But yeah, I don’t know if this was for digital
video, or just data storage.

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:23.160
This next cassette here is definitely meant
for digital video. Now, this cassette is still

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.449
large, but not nearly as large as the last.
One interesting thing is you can designate

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:32.439
4 or 8 channel by turning this little screw.
I assume that is the number of audio channels.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:37.839
And here is is compared to a regular VHS cassette.
These were used for storing high definition

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:44.320
video back in the 1990s, probably in actual
digital camcorders.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:52.259
Moving along, this one is a a bit of an oddity.
It’s the Video 120 cassette from 1975. It

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:56.960
has this little tag handing here saying to
“remove shipping blocks before use.” There

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.949
are actually two independent spindles here
that can be moved because the spools are actually

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:05.720
on top of each other, presumably moving in
opposite directions. Also, it inserts at this

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.220
end, so that means you would load it this
direction. Anyway, this was a failed home

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.170
video format. And here where it says do not
open, well…I’ll open it anyway. Yep, there’s

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.350
the tape.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:22.199
Here’s something neat. This is an ADAT digital
mastering audio cassette. It holds 42 minutes

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:26.540
of audio. And if you think it looks like a
VHS cassette, you aren’t crazy. That’s

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:32.040
basically exactly what it is. It is for the
Alesis ADAT 8-track audio recorder, which

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.369
was designed to use VHS video cassettes. But,
some companies like Ampex made special high

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:41.550
quality cassettes marketed for use with these
machines. And here it is next to a regular

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.670
VHS, as you can see, it is identical.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:50.100
THIS… Is a movie on 8mm video cassette.
Which, is a bit unusual because movies were

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.269
never really distributed on 8mm format. Which
is unfortunate since it was a higher quality

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:58.720
format and the tapes were definitely smaller
than VHS. Unfortunately, in this case I’m

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.779
missing the actual cassette, but needless
to say it looks like an ordinary 8mm cassette

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:06.939
with an Indiana Jones label on it. These were
most likely sold to airlines as they used

00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:11.390
these cassettes for onboard movies throughout
most of the 90s since the tapes and the players

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.769
were much smaller and lighter than regular
VCRs.

00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:19.490
I’ve shown you huge cassettes, now it’s
time to look at a really tiny one. This is

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:24.379
a Datasonix cassette. These were actually
digital backup tapes for use with computers.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:29.029
LGR did an in-depth episode and demonstration
on these. Here it is compared with a regular

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:30.730
audio cassette.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.720
And this is a MicroMV video cassette. These
were used in some digital camcorders starting

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:41.089
in 2001, and was discontinued in 2006 after
being considered a market failure. These held

00:16:41.089 --> 00:16:45.959
60 minutes of video stored in an MPEG2 data
stream. Since it is a video cassette, let’s

00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:51.149
compare with VHS. Although Mini-DV is a better
comparison, as it was the real competition

00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:53.769
for this format.

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:59.089
This is an 8mm data cassette. It looks identical
to an 8mm video cassette, and it more or less

00:16:59.089 --> 00:17:03.439
is. The main difference is just the labeling,
and the intended use, which is for data backup

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.550
storage.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:10.070
This one is far more interesting. This is
another data cassette, which stores 600 MB.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.679
It has a surprising weight to it. But, you
can see it is roughly the same shape as a

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:19.710
traditional audio cassette. But, I am not
entirely sure what these were used for.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:25.900
And this is a Micro Video Cassette from 1980.
You might say this is a predecessor to the

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.540
8mm video cassette, as it was marketed towards
the same goal, but never saw much use outside

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:36.200
of Japan. And here it is next to an 8mm for
size comparison.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.410
Here we have a DCC, or Digital Compact Cassette.
This has been covered a lot by Techmoan. This

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.970
particular cassette is a blank cassette, meant
for home recording. This is one format I wish

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.950
had gained more popularity. And maybe it would
have had it come out a few years earlier.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.440
It has a little protective sleeve here. But
otherwise, this is the same dimensions as

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.660
a regular compact cassette. This was done
so that players could be made backwards compatible

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.890
with the analog cassettes of the time. As
you can see all of the holes line up too.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.800
Moving backwards in time a bit, here is an
8-Track cassette. Of course 8-Tracks aren’t

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.860
rare, so, the only thing interesting about
this particular tape is that it is a blank

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.210
cassette, meant to be recorded on. The vast
majority of 8-Tracks were pre-recorded from

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.870
the factory. Admittedly, the 8-Track is an
inherently bad design and one that I’m not

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.790
sad to see go away!

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:27.450
Here’s something very similar to an 8-Track.
This tiny little thing is a special cassette

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.370
used in some Sinclair microcomputers, called
a ZX Microdrive. And the reason it is similar

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.000
to an 8-track is because it is a continuous
spool design that just keeps going around

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.300
and around. These could hold about 85 kilobytes
of data.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.450
And here’s a similar technology that was
tried on the market, called a Stringy floppy.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.400
And this one looks quite stringy indeed. One
problem with this is because the tape is moved

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.340
entirely by the capstan, there is no way to
spool the tape back inside if it comes out

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:57.270
like this. There aren’t even any screws
to take it apart. Anyway, probably best that

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.880
these didn’t succeed either!

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.740
Of course, talking about magnetic formats,
there are dozens of different home-backup

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.630
solutions that came out, and because they
were meant to be used for backup, interchangeability

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.940
with other people wasn’t that important,
so this meant a lot of proprietary formats

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.030
were created. And frankly, there are just
too many to show, but I’ll show a few interesting

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:22.040
ones. This is an iOmega Ditto cartridge, which
is tape based. But this is a Syquest cartridge,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.500
which is a hard disk platter inside. And this
is kind of a weird one. It’s a really long

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.010
cartridge, and it inserts into the machine
like this. And here’s one you might not

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.940
have heard of before, the iOmega REV disk.
These came in neat little cartridges like

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.300
this and opening it up here, you can see it
is also a hard disk platter of some sort inside.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.980
And of course, there are numerous professional
backup devices as well, and some of these

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.010
overlapped with the consumer market, so there
isn’t always an obvious dividing line here.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.570
This is a DDS cassette. But one I find more
interesting are the DLT and LTO tapes. They

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.890
only have a single spool inside, which means
the cartridges take up less space, and then

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.010
when they are placed inside the machine, it
will grab the end of the spool and attach

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.590
it to another spool inside the machine. When
it is done, it rewinds the spool back inside

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.640
the cartridge and ejects it.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:14.160
I guess this classifies as optical media,
right? This is an old roll of film used in

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.840
classrooms. This one is called “discovering
the library.” The interesting thing is,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.510
you can see this was last used in 1997, which
surprises me. I was in elementary school during

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.490
the early 1980s the last time I saw a film
projector used in a classroom. Nevertheless,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.880
let’s open this up and have a look at it.
So here’s the leader, and you’d need to

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.430
run this threw the projector and then attach
it to another spool to collect it. Now, it

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.440
appears this film also has an audio track
stored on it as well. Which for me, brings

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.550
back memories of terrible sounding audio,
from a half-blown out speaker, in a brick

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:52.700
classroom with a horrible echo. And thus,
this is a format I really don’t miss.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:57.150
And what we have here is something similar.
This is an actual cartoon that was sold on

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:01.380
film for consumers to buy and play on their
own projectors. I’m not really sure what

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.200
decade these were made in, though. I don’t
even think these have sound, either.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.110
So, not entirely optical, I have a few magneto-optical
disks to show first, starting with this, the

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:16.420
MO disc. These store 1.3 gigabytes per disc.
They are just about identical in size to a

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.220
regular floppy disk. Of course, it might be
best to compare with another magneto-optical

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.810
format, the minidisc. So, yeah, it’s a little
bit bigger than a minidisc, although it does

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.670
hold more data.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.960
And here’s another competitor to the floppy
disk, this is known as the Floptical Disk.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.550
They hold 21 megabytes of data, and as you
can see the are identical in shape and size.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.060
I think the drives were backwards compatible
with regular floppies.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.650
Next up is the data play disc. These tiny
optical disks hold 500 megabytes, or 250 megabytes

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:50.041
per side. Techmoan also did a good video covering
these in detail, for those interested. This

00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:54.150
is another format that I think deserved to
succeed, but just didn’t make it.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:59.970
Next up is the Sanyo ID photo disk. As you
can see it holds 730 megabytes of data. I

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.750
think these were being aimed at digital cameras
and the like, but never really caught on.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.720
They are basically just a tiny little compact
disk in there, much like a data play disc.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.390
OK, and while everyone is familiar with optical
discs, I bet most of you have never seen optical

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:20.940
discs this big. These are giant optical disk
cartridges. This one holds 6.8 gigabytes.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:28.330
And, I don’t even know what kind of disc
is in there. These are just a little bit smaller.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:34.530
Smaller is a relative term here. I think these
might have been used for video. Some of these

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:41.450
are possibly WORM discs, cause its write-once,
read-many that were used in archival storage.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:46.280
This looks like something that, yeah, was
probably more likely used in like a data center

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:53.230
of some kind. And this one here is actually
still brand new in the box. So, let’s open

00:22:53.230 --> 00:23:03.661
this thing up. This is something else. I’ve
never seen anything like this before. This

00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:07.050
is a Philips laser magnetic storage?

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.740
I’ve actually not been able to find out
much of anything about this format. It has

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.670
shutters on each side like this. Definitely
looks like a 12” sized disc in there, much

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.320
like a laserdisc. Maybe somebody can shed
some light in the comments.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.520
But this one, I think, is is probably the
most interesting. It actually comes with it’s

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.880
own little carry case. That’s actually like
really cool. Let’s take a look at this thing.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.480
I haven’t been able to find out much about
this either, other than it is a WORM disc,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.280
so you can only write to it one time. Apparently
it is also CAV, or constant angular velocity,

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.400
so it has the same amount of data on the inner
tracks as the outer. Now, if you try to open

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.880
this cover by hand, it won’t budge. But
if you grab this little slider on the side,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.340
it will open up for us. And looking at these
lines, we can definitely confirm that it is

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.870
hard sectored and CAV, just as it said it
was.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:57.140
They also have two write protect notches,
one for each side. And they are pretty serious

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.890
about making sure you don’t move them by
accident, since it requires poking something

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.130
down in this hole to release the switch in
either direction.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:10.320
And here’s another that is kind of similar.
This is also a write-once media, called LM4000.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.010
It also opens from the side. And you can actually
move this one too.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:20.590
OK, so here’s one for you. This is a PD
Disc. PD stands for phase-change dual. It’s

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:26.490
a re-writable optical technology based on
the regular compact disc dimensions and capacity.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:32.110
Introduced in 1995, they hold 650 Megabytes.
I used to use these a lot back in the day,

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.300
and I guess I must have been the only one
because I haven’t met anyone else that used

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.871
them. I found them much more reliable than
regular CD-R. These are hard sectored, as

00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:44.480
you can see. And you can tell they are CLV
because there are more sectors on the outer

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.300
part than on the inner part. They have a little
notch up here you can move to write-protect

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.300
the disc.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.900
And, I also happen to have a PD drive here
to show you. So, this is just an ordinary

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:58.140
sized optical drive that you would mount in
a PC. This particular one is IDE interface.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.650
And when opened, it has a little tray like
this. And the cartridge fits down in here

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:08.730
like so. Pretty simple. Of course, the drive
was also designed to be able to read regular

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.750
CD audio and CD-ROM discs as well. And they
just fit right in there like so. Now, in case

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.650
you are wondering what these little clips
are for, I’ll show you. If your optical

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.800
drive was mounted on its side. Or your computer
were on it’s side, these clips were designed

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.920
to help you load regular CDs without them
falling out, like so.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:33.570
So, that’s PD media. Now, if you haven’t
heard of it before, you may have possibly

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:39.070
heard of it’s successor, called DVD-RAM,
which came out in 1997. This was also a type

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:44.200
of phase-change disc, but using higher density.
The cartridges are almost identical, and in

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.890
fact most DVD-RAM drives were backwards compatible
with PD media so they could use either one.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:54.710
As you can see, the DVD-RAM is also hard-sectored.
But one interesting thing, the cartridge says

00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:00.330
it is 5.2 GB, but it doesn’t work exactly
like you might think. This cartridge is double-sided,

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.980
with a side A and B. It’s sort of reminiscent
of old floppy disks in that regard. In fact,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.911
it has two write-protect notches, one for
each side. So, really, each side of the cartridge

00:26:09.911 --> 00:26:14.460
has only 2.6 gigabytes. Which, is still a
lot more than the PD media had.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.950
A competing format was NEC’s MVDisc, which
was a market failure. But it also looks very

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:25.410
similar and holds 5.2 GB. But it is not compatible
with DVD-RAM. Unfortunately, I don’t know

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:30.060
much about this format. Of course, I do need
to mention that DVD-RAM did get an upgrade

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.530
to these 9.4 GB versions. Now, there’s a
few interesting things about these. Same cartridge

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.050
dimensions. And drives that used these were
also backward compatible with the previous

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:44.160
media as well. But they do have one unusual
feature. The cartridges were designed to open

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.570
up, if you press in just the right place.
And the reason is because some other types

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.340
of DVD drives were becoming compatible with
DVD-RAM but didn’t use the cartridge. So

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.670
this made the discs compatible between drives
that did or did not use the cartridge. Of

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.590
course, being these were considered a professional
format, keeping them in the cartridge was

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.390
ideal for protecting them.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.470
Most of you are probably at least familiar
with laserdiscs. They came on these huge 12

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:13.060
inch discs, the size of vinyl records. I find
these interesting because these things actually

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:18.760
record analog data on an optical disc. Laserdiscs
are generally two sided and the way they are

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.080
made is by sandwiching two discs together
with a layer of adhesive in the middle. Each

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.210
side holds about an hour of video, so two
hours for a single disc.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.320
However, let me show you some more obscure
laserdiscs types. So this is a music video

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.330
single. This is by no means one of my favorite
artists, but I found this in a thrift store

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.740
years ago and bought it because 8” laserdiscs
are so rare. So, basically it’s the same

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.850
concept just on a smaller disc and can only
hold about 20 minutes of video, and this particular

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:50.670
version is single sided, so it is the same
thickness as a regular compact disc. So, holding

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.340
it in your hands feels a lot like holding
an oversized music CD.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.590
But here’s something even more rare. This
is called CD Video. And this disc is a hybrid

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:05.870
between laserdisc and a music CD. If you’ll
notice there are 4 audio tracks on this, that

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:11.190
any regular CD player could play, but then
track 5 is a music video, slightly under 3

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.990
minutes. The video portion is playable on
a laserdisc player. And if you look at the

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.630
disc you can actually see two different rings
of data because the analog video data looks

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:24.190
different on the disc surface than digital
audio. This was supposed to be how music singles

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.400
would be released on laserdisc, but for some
reason the concept never took off, and these

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.730
are really rare today.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:35.110
But then, what I have here is even more obscure.
This says CD video, but I’m not sure what

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.970
makes it a CD-Video exactly, because it is
on an 8 inch disc, and is also double sided.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:44.810
So it would never fit in a CD player of any
kind, thus requiring a laserdisc player. So,

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.600
I’m a little confused on why this isn’t
just called a laserdisc. I’m sure somebody

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.900
in the comments will explain.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:55.281
And of course, you can’t talk about laserdisc
without talking about RCA Selectavision. These

00:28:55.281 --> 00:29:00.430
aren’t really optical discs, rather capacitive.
I think Techmoan did a good video explaining

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:05.060
these. Of course, inside the cartridge you’d
find a dark looking disc like this. This one

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.000
has seen better days, of course. And then
of course, there’s another type of video

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.341
on disc. This one is called VHD. This format
wasn’t really ever sold in the USA, but

00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:19.020
had some success in Japan and Europe. It is
also stored inside of a plastic cartridge

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.600
and again, I believe Techmoan did a great
video explaining about this format.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.530
So, moving along. I thought this was another
video format for a kid’s game console, but

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:32.330
later on, I realized it was a game, not an
actual video. Still, it is a great idea to

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.280
put this inside of a cartridge as you really
can’t expect kids to handle optical discs

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.890
with the care they need to keep them from
getting scratched up. Although this one is

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.130
somehow a little dirty anyway.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:47.730
Moving along, these discs actually really
are a video format. These came out in 2003.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:52.600
The Video Now format uses a technology identical
to the original compact disc to manufacture

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.210
the discs, but the discs themselves are slightly
smaller than a regular CD or DVD. So, for

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.750
comparison, here’s a regular old DVD and
you can see the VideoNow disc is slightly

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:07.020
smaller. These were actually meant to be played
in these little kid’s video players with

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.900
a tiny screen on them like this. These discs
could hold a little over 20 minutes of low-quality

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.920
video at 15 frames per second. But, kids probably
didn’t care about the quality, especially

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.930
on the tiny screen.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.800
So here’s another weird format. This is
called a DIVX disc. And a lot of people confuse

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.150
that with the video codec known as DIVX, which
is spelled the exact same way. But there is

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:33.450
actually nothing at all related between the
two things, other than the name. It’s the

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.840
same physical structure as a regular DVD,
but it was encrypted differently. DIVX discs

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.910
were considered a rental format where you
would buy the disc for a few dollars, but

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.590
in order to play it, your DIVX player would
connect with a modem to an online service

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.330
and charge your account every time you play
the disc. This system was being pushed by

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:55.760
Circuit City in the early days as a competitor
to DVD. Some companies such as LucasArts and

00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:01.250
Disney were choosing to only release movies
on this format in the early days. Fortunately,

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.750
it was a market failure.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:08.110
Now here’s another type of rental format.
This was also a disc you would buy for a few

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:12.450
bucks, and take home. Notice that it has a
caution label “do not open until ready to

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:17.550
watch movie.” It says over here that “the
disc will discolor and become unplayable 48

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.050
hours after the vacuum seal is broken.”
And obviously, this one is already discolored

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:27.310
and unplayable. These were meant to be played
and thrown in the trash. Probably not great

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.150
for the environment, but notice they call
it a green disc and emphasize that it can

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:37.181
be recycled. Yeah, right. I bet had these
taken off, most would be in landfills. Probably

00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:40.840
another format we can be glad didn’t succeed.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.790
And another type of DVD is, of course, HD-DVD.
This was a competitor to Bluray that came

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:51.610
out in 2006. I suspect most people have long
forgotten about this. And I suppose one neat

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:56.140
thing about this was that they could be hybrid
discs. So, this one for example has the content

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.840
in high definition on side A, but then flip
it over and side B was a traditional DVD.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.170
So this format could have made a great successor
to DVD since you could start buying the high

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.850
def stuff before you even upgraded your player!

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.480
Next up. I think this is some sort of religious
thing. But what makes it an interesting format

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:19.500
is that it is a hybrid. So, notice on this
side it says DVD. But, if you flip it over,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:24.580
notice that it says CD over here. So you can
play this as a video disc, or a music CD depending

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.610
on which side you use. So, that’s pretty
neat.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:32.600
And here’s another sort of weird hybrid.
So, on this side it is a regular CD for music.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.270
But, turn it over and it is a vinyl record.
And since CDs are actually read from the bottom

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.860
anyway, technically this disc is always played
with the vinyl side up. As you can see this

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:47.510
is called a Vinyldisc. Now, it can only hold
3.5 minutes of audio on the vinyl side. And

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.890
while there is more physical space for grooves,
it's not used because it would technically

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.720
bring most record player’s tone arms in
closer to the center than they were designed.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.900
Still, a very neat concept.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.890
OK, so here’s something you may not have
seen. This is a CD, believe it or not. Of

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.140
course, if you turn it over you’ll see it’s
basically just a standard 3 inch single with

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.490
a bunch of extra plastic. Now, one thing that
occurs to me is that clearly there is more

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.010
plastic on the bottom than on the top. So
you’d think this would play out of balance.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:19.710
But, I suspect since this is an audio CD,
it plays at 1X speed, so it probably doesn’t

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.600
have enough RPM to cause it to wobble.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.990
Next up here, we have what appears to be a
classical music CD. But, what makes it different

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:32.780
is that it is considered a “Super Audio
CD.” These came out in 1999 and were supposed

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.020
to offer higher quality and more channels
over the traditional 2 channels. They use

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.080
DVD technology to hold a lot more data on
the disc. But, these were a market failure

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.270
as almost nobody could tell the difference
between this and regular CD quality.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:51.440
Here’s a bit of a mysterious one. It looks
like a CD. You may notice it says “MODisc”

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.390
on the center. Well, I presume that means
magneto-optical disc of some sort. But I haven’t

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:59.770
been able to find any data on this. One interesting
thing is that you can actually see right through

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:05.480
it. A very similar looking disc here actually
is called an M-Disc. And This is just an archival

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.511
type of DVD recordable, but interestingly
enough, it is also somewhat transparent. These

00:34:10.511 --> 00:34:14.379
were supposed to be more reliable than regular
DVD for long-term storage. Of course, this

00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:18.760
poor thing is scratched to pieces, so I doubt
it would read anyway.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.599
And another type of writable disc. This is
a CD-RW, but what makes it unique is that

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:30.399
is a double-density CD-RW. And it holds 1.3
GB of data. Obviously it would require a proprietary

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:32.869
drive to burn and read these, though.

00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:38.450
And one more video format. This is the Sony
Professional Disc. This came out in 2003 and

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:43.099
was sort of a predecessor to Bluray, as it
uses similar technology. These were used in

00:34:43.099 --> 00:34:47.129
some of Sony’s camcorder products for video
recording, but were also used as a data storage

00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:51.829
product that could hold 23 gigabytes of data.
One thing I think is really cool about it

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:58.150
is how the shutter works, watch this. Isn’t
that cool? It has a write protect notch right

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:02.440
here. These were pretty cool, but when Bluray
came out, this technology was discontinued.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:08.130
Here’s another more commercial type optical
disk called UDO or ultra-density optical.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:14.160
These were first introduced by Sony in the
year 2000. Notice that it has dual shutters.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.000
You can see there are two very thick discs
inside there, facing opposite directions,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.530
of course. This disc can hold 30 Gigabytes,
but later models could hold up to 80 Gigabytes.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:28.269
Here’s another similar media, I think this
may have been the predecessor to UDO, but

00:35:28.269 --> 00:35:30.259
I’m not sure.

00:35:30.259 --> 00:35:35.450
Speaking of weird Sony formats, here’s an
Optical Disc Archive. These were considered

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:41.240
a competitor to LTO tapes for enterprise backups
and storage. Presumably you insert this entire

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:47.589
cartridge into a machine. But, lets have a
look inside. Apparently what we have are 12

00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:51.650
write-once optical discs. I’m not entirely
sure what kind of discs these are, but they

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.420
obviously hold about 25 gigabytes each, so
probably similar to Bluray.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:00.620
I have one more media type to show, but this
doesn’t fit any particular category. This

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.579
is a bubble memory cartridge from the 1980s.
This was a type of non-volatile RAM that could

00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:09.700
be used for storage, much like flash memory
is used today. So you might call this the

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.009
predecessor to the SD card or something.

00:36:13.009 --> 00:36:16.789
And I have to give a shout out to the latest
episode of Red Dwarf where they have apparently

00:36:16.789 --> 00:36:22.740
constructed the largest floppy disk ever.
And, of course, a giant floppy drive to match!

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.000
And that about wraps this up. Now, I’m sure
there’s going to be some person that’s

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.360
like screaming at their computer screen going,
“But…. But, you didn’t show this or

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.720
that type of media!” So, just to be clear,
this was never meant to be like all-inclusive.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.180
I’m sure there’s some media types I didn’t
cover. But hopefully everybody learned at

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.109
least something interesting about some old
types of media.

00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:45.220
Also a big thanks goes out to Foone Turing
and Kevin Williams for loaning me many of

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.839
the different types of media that you’ve
seen in this video. Also, if there’s a particular

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:53.579
type of media that you think deserves it’s
own dedicated video to explore it further,

00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:56.520
then tell me about it in the comments or send
me an email!

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.269
As always, stick around for the next episode,
and thanks for watching!
