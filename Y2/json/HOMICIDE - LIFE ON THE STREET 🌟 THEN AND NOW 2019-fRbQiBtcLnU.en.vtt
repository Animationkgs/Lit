Hello! Julia here and you are watching a new episode of HOW THEY CHANGED.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:35.840
The best cop show of recent times – one of the most innovative and influential dramas of all time – was set not in New York, Miami or LA, but in Baltimore.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.400
It featured a squad of embattled, super smart, sardonic detectives fighting against the drug dealing and killing blitzing their beloved city.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.280
This series stemmed from the pen of the godlike David Simon and was as literate, funny and deep as television could be.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.560
But it was not The Wire. It was Homicide: Life On The Street.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:13.480
The fact that “The Wire” was on HBO and not network TV certainly allowed it to push boundaries, and it obviously influenced every crime drama that followed it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.600
However, Simon has said multiple times that without “Homicide,” there wouldn’t have been a “Wire”.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.240
“Homicide” is the true progenitor of the modern crime drama.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:37.240
Simon regards Homicide as "a series of interconnected short stories", comparing it – rather grandiosely – to James Joyce's Dubliners.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.000
For me, Homicide is the missing link between Hill Street Blues and The Wire.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.960
The links with The Wire and the book are myriad.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:02:01.560
In one hilarious episode, detectives Munch and Bolander re-enact Simon's anecdote about a suspect confessing after taking a "lie-detection test" – using the station photocopier.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.760
"Then David went and did it in The Wire," Fontana protests.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.800
"I was like, 'Dude! We already did it.' He said, 'Yeah I know, but I wanted to do it again.'"

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.320
“Homicide” was far ahead of its time in every respect.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.320
It more or less created the mood and aesthetics of contemporary crime dramas.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:35.520
This was thanks to the vision and hard work of “Rain Man” director Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, who would later go on to create “Oz.”

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:48.700
The quality of the scripts attracted star names such as Kathryn Bigelow, Steve Buscemi, John Waters, Kathy Bates and James Earl James.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:03:00.680
Edie Falco, Elijah Wood and Jake Gyllenhaal made early appearances, as did Chris Rock, as a paedophile suspected of killing Adena.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.980
Barry Levinson established the show's groundbreaking visual style from episode one,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:19.600
draining it of color and shooting entirely on hand-held cameras that swooped in and out of the actors' faces, jabbing at them like a boxer.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.940
And, amazingly, the killing of schoolgirl Adena Watson was left unsolved.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:37.160
"That would never happen now. We live in the world of procedural crime dramas now," Fontana laments, referring to CSI – which he openly disdains.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:50.900
Although it managed to run for seven seasons from1993 to 1999, it’s not controversial to suggest that “Homicide” had bad luck.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.920
NBC could never seem to figure out how to pitch it so it would resonate with audiences.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:11.680
They didn’t ignore it: the show’s first episode won the coveted post-Super Bowl time slot, and NBC continued to order episodes even though ratings weren’t great.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.640
Sure, not all the choices NBC made were helpful, but maybe we just weren’t ready yet.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.520
While audiences didn’t fully embrace the show, the critics did.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.580
The show received heaps of accolades, and won three Peabody Awards.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.500
The show took risks at every turn.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.520
"The network would say, 'Where's the pretty girl? Where's the hunky guy?'

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.680
We had Danny Baldwin! We had the least attractive cast on television!"

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:56.820
Over time, the show managed to build a comfortable - if not spectacular - audience, and traded in several of the older, less conventionally attractive cast members for young studs.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.180
I would love for younger viewers to be able to get their hands on “Homicide".

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:11.220
In a better world, their perspective would help old folks like me better understand the show — and its place in TV history.
