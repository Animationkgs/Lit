alfalfa [5k]: they seemed to think that they could only make it worse by cutting
LinuxGooo [11k]: Whats their argument ? Mr., we need at least 6 pieces broken, not only 5. :-)
alfalfa [5k]: i think it has to do with the likelihood of success
heckki [3k]: yes scar tissue makes about 1/2 of vertabrae surgeryi problems come back
alfalfa [5k]: if they operate and i don't get better it ruins their numbers
LinuxGooo [11k]: you mean their budget:-)
alfalfa [5k]: i think in this case it is more about reputation
LinuxGooo [11k]: more successfull, more money floods in. :-)
alfalfa [5k]: well sure
heckki [3k]: as opposed to "do no harm"
alfalfa [5k]: they prescribe pain pills for me, but i hardly ever take them
LinuxGooo [11k]: hm ... pain killers are heavily addictive.
LinuxGooo [11k]: can only be a temporary solution.
alfalfa [5k]: they are like "air freshener" -- the underlying problem is still there, the "remedy" only masks it
heckki [3k]: for some problems there are no good solutions so I admire your cheery presence on KGS
alfalfa [5k]: aw, shucks
LinuxGooo [11k]: pitty, indeed.
LinuxGooo [11k]: life is dangerious ...
heckki [3k]: one bad day and your life changes for a long time
cekalo [1k]: i watched a video about Trigeminal Neuralgia
cekalo [1k]: sounds like a horrible illness
LinuxGooo [11k]: 2 months ago I was nearby killed by a car. It was a glimps of a second. Luckily I had the fast reaction to jump aside before the bus hit me when walking along.
heckki [3k]: say  more about Trii germinal Neuralgia
heckki [3k]: one time Tai chi saved me from being hit by a car
akinn [3k]: the rest of the time it probably saved you from trigeminal neuralgia
heckki [3k]: I was crossing the street in St Croix when I noticed a Volkwagon bug coming around the corner at high speed
heckki [3k]: just like in the movies time slowed way down
heckki [3k]: I had been learning Tai chi every morning from my room mate
alfalfa [5k]: that happened to me while i was falling of the roof!  it was the longest three seconds of my life
akinn [3k]: i dont want tot hink about such moments
alfalfa [5k]: time seemed to "expand"
heckki [3k]: in A Tai chi like movement I put my hand out and onto the curved hood of the bug
akinn [3k]: it has been  year or more that no car almost ran my over
alfalfa [5k]: the first thing i had to do was to get my leg out from between ladder-rungs
alfalfa [5k]: or it would have been snapped
akinn [3k]: and that is actually rather relacing
heckki [3k]: such the momentum threw up into air and over to the side
akinn [3k]: that is clearly not "a tai chi like movement" i figure
heckki [3k]: threw me
akinn [3k]: just simply tai chi
alfalfa [5k]: and it seemed like an eternity, but i got my leg out, and kicked the ladder away, and then turned so that i would land on my butt
heckki [3k]: so you almost came out ok but unforetunately not
akinn [3k]: concrete is a serious problem sorry to say
flutterby [1k]: in what way is conrete a serious problem?
akinn [3k]: lots of people fall on it
heckki [3k]: when falling from a distance onto it
heckki [3k]: especially
akinn [3k]: especially from a distance yes
heckki [3k]: not forgiving at all
Animation [6k]: tai chi is cool
Animation [6k]: whatever helps develop mindfulness
Falcon89 [4k?]: nice
Animation [6k]: The bags of green and white peas that i purchased in January for 1$/kg are coming in useful
alfalfa [5k]: impromptu go stones?
Animation [6k]: they are nutritious
Animation [6k]: I cooked them inside an inner-lidded 1litre pressure cooker with 3 whole potatoes and some brown rice with the husk
alfalfa [5k]: sounds tasty, i like the idea of combining legumes and grains
alfalfa [5k]: in the same meal
alfalfa [5k]: something about eight essential amino acids
Animation [6k]: Inner-lidded pressure cooker gets a higher temperature and pressure than the normal kind of pressure cooker
alfalfa [5k]: interesting
Animation [6k]: the peas practically dissolve away nto the water, leaving the skin floating in the broth
Animation [6k]: Takes a long time to cool off
Animation [6k]: i don't even bother soaking them overnight
alfalfa [5k]: pease porridge hot.  pease porridge cold.  // pease porridge in the pot, nine days old.
Animation [6k]: And i don't bother slicing the potato either

[21:23:30] Khaleesi: ericj - petg0 = NaN
[21:23:36] Marathon: saying "pan-pan" 3 times is a distress call, but less important than one that uses "mayday" 3 times

[00:35:04] Eliza: dual in-line package
[00:35:11] Now: It gives you horse like arms
[00:35:27] LinuxGooo: you still can go into a pub ??? which government allows still pubs, cinemas, theatres etc. ... to keep open ??
[00:35:29] Khaleesi: do you aspire to be a horse?
[00:36:13] LinuxGooo: in NL pubs are closed by government since weeks, at least till 28th April.
[00:36:41] LinuxGooo: 21st will be a press conference by the minister to decide if prolonged.
[00:38:33] Now: A centaure would be in case, Khaleesi
[00:40:10] cronin: doesn't a centaure have six limbs?
[00:40:24] Muttley: no, that's a camel

[00:42:25] Muttley: worn out two running machines already
[00:42:36] cronin: gym owners hate him!
[00:42:37] Now: that added weight is the key

[00:46:24] Now: do you still have enemies? we are in the age of aquarius, switch out
[00:47:44] Epsilion: i'm not sure, just covering my bases
[00:49:44] Now: I am sure no one want to be your enemy
[00:50:50] DeaconJohn: not now anyway.   what with Cov19 out and around.
[01:07:54] needwin: need one more person for rengo.
