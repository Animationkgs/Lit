[20:06:07] scientia: Hi guys, any c programmer with experience on tcp/ip?
[20:19:43] UTDEspy: Are you talking "Writing a program that does networking" or are you actually talking at the networking layer / driver / embedded level?
[20:25:19] Marathon: the 2020 united states go congress has been canceled.
[20:25:30] Marathon: why did it take so long for them to decide that?
[20:25:46] UTDEspy: The right, sad, decision. A lot of people have been putting things off in the hopes that maybe something, some how would fix things.
[20:26:10] UTDEspy: Some venue holders have cancelation policies that make it extremely expensive so people were waiting until it was literally illegal to have the con, which changes how insurance and stuff manage things
[20:26:44] scientia: writing a program that does networking, just wondering about good resources to learn
[20:27:21] UTDEspy: Oooh, good news Scientia - You probably won't need to actually get into any of the ACTUAL communication. For C you're probably going to want to look up "Sockets"
[20:27:42] UTDEspy: By ACTUAL communication I mean error handling, handshakes, the tcp/ip stuff
[20:27:59] UTDEspy: You'll tend to just get a bitstream that's already been put through that process, so there's More reliability
[20:28:30] scientia: the actual communication seems more interesting now that you said it
[20:29:11] UTDEspy: Hahaha, it's great, and interesting, and I hope you never have to do it
[20:29:21] scientia: but yes I have been reading about sockets
[20:29:38] UTDEspy: As fun it can be a lot of fun to poke around, but actually mucking about at lower levels can be a pain with no gain
[20:29:50] alfalfa: this is the best C code i have ever seen for keeping track of multiple sockets/network connections:
[20:29:53] alfalfa: https://userver.uwaterloo.ca/
[20:30:15] alfalfa: you can learn a lot just by reading that code
[20:30:37] scientia: great! thanks man
[20:30:41] alfalfa: yw
[20:30:58] Equinox: f.a.b.
[20:31:48] scientia: UTDEspy but learning is valuable
[20:32:21] scientia: maybe you have some great read on the lower level stuff?
[20:32:45] UTDEspy: All my lowerlevel stuff was based on the CCNA curriculum ages ago, before, ironically, it was super easy to find good resources online
[20:33:04] UTDEspy: Ran through CCNA and CCNP stuff and paid a ton of attention and it's just rattled around in my head since
[20:34:00] Zahlman: hi espy, good to see you again
[20:34:10] UTDEspy: I'd suggest looking up the OSI 7 Layer Model and TCP/IP handshakes
[20:34:52] UTDEspy: Just about any site talking about that should give you some idea. It helps to think about what levels you're actually touching for framing of the problem space, but also to NOT get too bogged down in what other layers are doing
[20:34:57] alfalfa: mmm, seven-layer dip
[20:35:11] UTDEspy: Hey Zahlman! Yeah, good to be back, it's been too long
[20:35:24] UTDEspy: I'm tryin to do the teaching game thing again
[20:35:31] scientia: nice thanks man

[22:51:57] papaya: i never understood why we couldn't publicly accuse selfish players
[22:52:00] reduced50: Most of the probems I witness on KGS are my own bad moves
[22:52:07] papaya: shouldn't others beware of these people?
[22:52:23] bolbi: feel free to read the FAQ, papaya
[22:54:26] papaya: seems like a decent system
[22:54:37] kindred: public accusations get old very quickly
[22:54:40] papaya: i mean, escapers are eventually punished after 6 months
[22:54:58] bolbi: before 6 months
[22:55:25] kindred: 10 or so games escaped, before they start to forfeit the games
[22:55:44] bolbi: sometimes, they lose as soon as they escape
[22:55:53] kindred: yes
[22:55:57] Now: jeez 8 victories in a row and still my rank doesn´t go up
[22:56:26] papaya: probably just need one more!
[22:56:30] Now: uh no, I lost one yesterday
[22:56:33] regularfit: years ago i had 41 vitories in a row without promoting
[22:56:36] regularfit: no joke
[22:57:41] Now: that´s bad
[22:58:18] regularfit: thats due to the broad time window of weighted average they have here
[23:03:53] JY0034: who are the admins?
[23:04:36] kindred: they're the ones with five pointed star next to their name
[23:04:51] bolbi: we have a gold or a silver star next to our name

[00:17:59] Eliza: there is an HTML version, but....
[00:18:10] Padre: Ok thanks. That's a headscratcher. Must be something technical?...
[00:18:26] alfalfa: no, social.
[00:18:47] alfalfa: Apple refuses to support Java, just out of spite and malice.
[00:19:09] alfalfa: so that's the reason we can't have nice things
[00:19:17] Eliza: mind you.... Java does suck
[00:19:24] alfalfa: no it doesn't
[00:19:30] Padre: Oh I see. Walled garden
[00:19:37] Marathon: so what?  what's needed isn't necessarily java support. what's needed is a common protocol.

[00:57:37] Eliza: my birthday....
[00:58:32] LGSam: Most of us only found out on April 11th
[00:58:55] LGSam: so we had been hoping and hoping for a while after it already happened
[00:58:55] radishimo: this is the first time it's been someone i knew at all on any level

[01:01:18] radishimo: i've spoken with people that have had acquintances die from it but it's always been second hand

[20:06:07] scientia: Hi guys, any c programmer with experience on tcp/ip?
[20:19:43] UTDEspy: Are you talking "Writing a program that does networking" or are you actually talking at the networking layer / driver / embedded level?
[20:25:19] Marathon: the 2020 united states go congress has been canceled.
[20:25:30] Marathon: why did it take so long for them to decide that?
[20:25:46] UTDEspy: The right, sad, decision. A lot of people have been putting things off in the hopes that maybe something, some how would fix things.
[20:26:10] UTDEspy: Some venue holders have cancelation policies that make it extremely expensive so people were waiting until it was literally illegal to have the con, which changes how insurance and stuff manage things
[20:26:44] scientia: writing a program that does networking, just wondering about good resources to learn
[20:27:21] UTDEspy: Oooh, good news Scientia - You probably won't need to actually get into any of the ACTUAL communication. For C you're probably going to want to look up "Sockets"
[20:27:42] UTDEspy: By ACTUAL communication I mean error handling, handshakes, the tcp/ip stuff
[20:27:59] UTDEspy: You'll tend to just get a bitstream that's already been put through that process, so there's More reliability
[20:28:30] scientia: the actual communication seems more interesting now that you said it
[20:29:11] UTDEspy: Hahaha, it's great, and interesting, and I hope you never have to do it
[20:29:21] scientia: but yes I have been reading about sockets
[20:29:38] UTDEspy: As fun it can be a lot of fun to poke around, but actually mucking about at lower levels can be a pain with no gain
[20:29:50] alfalfa: this is the best C code i have ever seen for keeping track of multiple sockets/network connections:
[20:29:53] alfalfa: https://userver.uwaterloo.ca/
[20:30:15] alfalfa: you can learn a lot just by reading that code
[20:30:37] scientia: great! thanks man
[20:30:41] alfalfa: yw
[20:30:58] Equinox: f.a.b.
[20:31:48] scientia: UTDEspy but learning is valuable
[20:32:21] scientia: maybe you have some great read on the lower level stuff?
[20:32:45] UTDEspy: All my lowerlevel stuff was based on the CCNA curriculum ages ago, before, ironically, it was super easy to find good resources online
[20:33:04] UTDEspy: Ran through CCNA and CCNP stuff and paid a ton of attention and it's just rattled around in my head since
[20:34:00] Zahlman: hi espy, good to see you again
[20:34:10] UTDEspy: I'd suggest looking up the OSI 7 Layer Model and TCP/IP handshakes
[20:34:52] UTDEspy: Just about any site talking about that should give you some idea. It helps to think about what levels you're actually touching for framing of the problem space, but also to NOT get too bogged down in what other layers are doing
[20:34:57] alfalfa: mmm, seven-layer dip
[20:35:11] UTDEspy: Hey Zahlman! Yeah, good to be back, it's been too long
[20:35:24] UTDEspy: I'm tryin to do the teaching game thing again
[20:35:31] scientia: nice thanks man

[22:52:07] papaya: shouldn't others beware of these people?
[22:52:23] bolbi: feel free to read the FAQ, papaya
[22:54:26] papaya: seems like a decent system
[22:54:37] kindred: public accusations get old very quickly
[22:54:40] papaya: i mean, escapers are eventually punished after 6 months
[22:54:58] bolbi: before 6 months
[22:55:25] kindred: 10 or so games escaped, before they start to forfeit the games
[22:55:44] bolbi: sometimes, they lose as soon as they escape
[22:55:53] kindred: yes
[22:55:57] Now: jeez 8 victories in a row and still my rank doesn´t go up
[22:56:26] papaya: probably just need one more!

[22:56:33] regularfit: years ago i had 41 vitories in a row without promoting
[22:56:36] regularfit: no joke
[22:57:41] Now: that´s bad
[22:58:18] regularfit: thats due to the broad time window of weighted average they have here
[23:03:53] JY0034: who are the admins?

[00:18:26] alfalfa: no, social.
[00:18:47] alfalfa: Apple refuses to support Java, just out of spite and malice.

[01:13:14] cronin: ah, bragging - the telltale sign of an insecure personality

[01:20:19] afgani: cronin  is jealous
[01:20:31] radishimo: "look at this 2k player bragging that he got to 1d, haha he thinks he's so good"
[01:20:38] radishimo: let's take a step back and look at that statement
[01:20:45] Now: I didn´t even think about that
[01:21:05] Now: in fact, I liked your statement of getting to 1d blacking out
[01:21:17] radishimo: like if i wasn't humble about that crap wouldn't i like.. not want to tell people i used to be ranked higher?
[01:21:27] radishimo: because the lower rank would be embarassing?
[01:21:32] radishimo: am i off base thinking that?
[01:21:54] radishimo: i wasn't in a good place and go still made me happy, that's kinda the point of what i was saying

[20:06:07] scientia: Hi guys, any c programmer with experience on tcp/ip?
[20:19:43] UTDEspy: Are you talking "Writing a program that does networking" or are you actually talking at the networking layer / driver / embedded level?
[20:25:19] Marathon: the 2020 united states go congress has been canceled.
[20:25:30] Marathon: why did it take so long for them to decide that?
[20:25:46] UTDEspy: The right, sad, decision. A lot of people have been putting things off in the hopes that maybe something, some how would fix things.
[20:26:10] UTDEspy: Some venue holders have cancelation policies that make it extremely expensive so people were waiting until it was literally illegal to have the con, which changes how insurance and stuff manage things
[20:26:44] scientia: writing a program that does networking, just wondering about good resources to learn
[20:27:21] UTDEspy: Oooh, good news Scientia - You probably won't need to actually get into any of the ACTUAL communication. For C you're probably going to want to look up "Sockets"
[20:27:42] UTDEspy: By ACTUAL communication I mean error handling, handshakes, the tcp/ip stuff
[20:27:59] UTDEspy: You'll tend to just get a bitstream that's already been put through that process, so there's More reliability
[20:28:30] scientia: the actual communication seems more interesting now that you said it
[20:29:11] UTDEspy: Hahaha, it's great, and interesting, and I hope you never have to do it
[20:29:21] scientia: but yes I have been reading about sockets
[20:29:38] UTDEspy: As fun it can be a lot of fun to poke around, but actually mucking about at lower levels can be a pain with no gain
[20:29:50] alfalfa: this is the best C code i have ever seen for keeping track of multiple sockets/network connections:
[20:29:53] alfalfa: https://userver.uwaterloo.ca/
[20:30:15] alfalfa: you can learn a lot just by reading that code
[20:30:37] scientia: great! thanks man
[20:30:41] alfalfa: yw
[20:30:58] Equinox: f.a.b.
[20:31:48] scientia: UTDEspy but learning is valuable
[20:32:21] scientia: maybe you have some great read on the lower level stuff?
[20:32:45] UTDEspy: All my lowerlevel stuff was based on the CCNA curriculum ages ago, before, ironically, it was super easy to find good resources online
[20:33:04] UTDEspy: Ran through CCNA and CCNP stuff and paid a ton of attention and it's just rattled around in my head since
[20:34:00] Zahlman: hi espy, good to see you again
[20:34:10] UTDEspy: I'd suggest looking up the OSI 7 Layer Model and TCP/IP handshakes
[20:34:52] UTDEspy: Just about any site talking about that should give you some idea. It helps to think about what levels you're actually touching for framing of the problem space, but also to NOT get too bogged down in what other layers are doing
[20:34:57] alfalfa: mmm, seven-layer dip
[20:35:11] UTDEspy: Hey Zahlman! Yeah, good to be back, it's been too long
[20:35:24] UTDEspy: I'm tryin to do the teaching game thing again
[20:35:31] scientia: nice thanks man

[22:52:00] reduced50: Most of the probems I witness on KGS are my own bad moves
[22:52:07] papaya: shouldn't others beware of these people?
[22:52:23] bolbi: feel free to read the FAQ, papaya
[22:54:26] papaya: seems like a decent system
[22:54:37] kindred: public accusations get old very quickly
[22:54:40] papaya: i mean, escapers are eventually punished after 6 months
[22:54:58] bolbi: before 6 months
[22:55:25] kindred: 10 or so games escaped, before they start to forfeit the games
[22:55:44] bolbi: sometimes, they lose as soon as they escape
[22:55:53] kindred: yes
[22:55:57] Now: jeez 8 victories in a row and still my rank doesn´t go up
[22:56:26] papaya: probably just need one more!

[22:56:33] regularfit: years ago i had 41 vitories in a row without promoting
[22:56:36] regularfit: no joke
[22:57:41] Now: that´s bad
[22:58:18] regularfit: thats due to the broad time window of weighted average they have here
[23:03:53] JY0034: who are the admins?
[23:04:36] kindred: they're the ones with five pointed star next to their name

[00:17:59] Eliza: there is an HTML version, but....
[00:18:10] Padre: Ok thanks. That's a headscratcher. Must be something technical?...
[00:18:26] alfalfa: no, social.
[00:18:47] alfalfa: Apple refuses to support Java, just out of spite and malice.
[00:19:09] alfalfa: so that's the reason we can't have nice things
[00:19:17] Eliza: mind you.... Java does suck
[00:19:24] alfalfa: no it doesn't
[00:19:30] Padre: Oh I see. Walled garden
[00:19:37] Marathon: so what?  what's needed isn't necessarily java support. what's needed is a common protocol.

[01:14:49] Now: so a lot of Go to play
[01:15:00] radishimo: it's too early
[01:15:09] radishimo: there will be a resurgence
[01:15:11] Now: more go even then
[01:15:17] radishimo: can't do anything to stop it, this is so sad
[01:16:26] Now: this is all the age of aquarius, energy has changed, new circle
[01:18:41] radishimo: why is saying what rank you are or were automatically bragging anyway
[01:18:47] VIXX: 9 of may will still be early stage yeah.. no doubt politicians will come forward touting a flattening curve, but indeed a resurgence will lurk for times to come
[01:19:02] radishimo: if anything it's a commentary on how i'm weaker now than i was then
[01:19:38] Now: it doesn´t matter, just play
[01:19:48] VIXX: i honestly don't see how that constitutes bragging either
[01:19:50] VIXX: haha
[01:20:13] radishimo: yeah like
[01:20:19] afgani: cronin  is jealous
[01:20:31] radishimo: "look at this 2k player bragging that he got to 1d, haha he thinks he's so good"
[01:20:38] radishimo: let's take a step back and look at that statement
[01:20:45] Now: I didn´t even think about that
[01:21:05] Now: in fact, I liked your statement of getting to 1d blacking out
[01:21:17] radishimo: like if i wasn't humble about that crap wouldn't i like.. not want to tell people i used to be ranked higher?
[01:21:27] radishimo: because the lower rank would be embarassing?
[01:21:32] radishimo: am i off base thinking that?
[01:21:54] radishimo: i wasn't in a good place and go still made me happy, that's kinda the point of what i was saying
[01:25:32] cronin: i think this conversation is getting really low class, and afgani, shut up, as you can't speak for me
[01:25:49] cronin: but i'm glad if you two found in each other a friend
[01:25:57] LGSam: I think
[01:26:14] LGSam: I think we should appreciate the fact that we are still here
[01:26:26] radishimo: look at the guy who wanted attention trying to highroad us now
[01:26:44] VIXX: hahaha, yeah, that wasn't pompous at all
[01:26:53] VIXX: none noticed lol
[01:27:06] radishimo: yes your internet philosophy is such an example on how we should cast aside mortal  considerations and think about bigger things
[01:27:38] radishimo: nevermind you started the whole thing with "hurrdurr did you lose a lot"
[01:29:41] Now: easily triggered
[01:30:04] Padre: again on the client for IOS thread I started earlier in this room - a KGS user pointed me to this: shin.gokgs.com.  I loaded it on an ipad in safari, was able to login and tried some game play. Worked really well!
[01:30:16] Padre: Does anyone else use that client?
[01:30:41] Muttley: I don't know how to
[01:30:44] Eliza: I tried it.... but it was so slow on my elderly ipad
[01:31:00] Muttley: It said I had to put an extension on chrome or something
[01:31:02] Padre: sounds like you need a relatively new/fast ipad...
[01:31:17] Muttley: so I did, but I didn't know what to do next :))
[01:31:20] Eliza: no... I don't need one.... this works
[01:31:25] Padre: I just loaded that URL in safari. Logged in and got going
[01:31:41] SimeonG: I'm using it right now, no extension needed
[01:31:53] Muttley: Well, Fredda vs Werfeus
[01:31:56] Muttley: watch that instead :)
[01:32:02] Padre: so no need for a native OSX client after all?... :-)
[01:32:48] Padre: I found one thing I didn't like - which is how you can hover over a point and see where the stone will actually drop when you click. Not working in the shin client
[01:33:03] Padre: you touch and hope your grubby finger tip is lined up on the right point :-)
[01:33:39] Padre: touch once and touch again to confirm as an option? 
[01:33:51] Padre: I guess I should ping the developer...
[01:34:39] nonosse: i use that too, just miss a few functionality but works well
[01:34:58] Padre: there's an email feedback link in the client to jkkramer@... anyone here know this person?  I would like to thank them :-)
[01:35:26] afgani: is  it true  that sushi is  really cheap in japan?
[01:35:35] nonosse: you can check on L19 forum
[01:36:11] Eliza: kaiten zushi is cheap
[01:36:42] afgani: whats that?
[01:36:49] radishimo: the conveyor belt
[01:36:56] radishimo: where they charge you per plate
[01:37:03] afgani: how much?
[01:37:05] radishimo: kaiten means rotate
[01:37:28] radishimo: it depends on the quality of place but it can be pretty stupid cheap as far as sushi goes
[01:39:41] frijoles: Any 1800 chess players here?
[01:40:56] afgani: no  c word in  the EGR
[01:42:31] VIXX: *raises hand*
[01:43:04] Eliza: don't worry.... we won't hold it against you
[01:44:24] Marathon: chess? is that the game with the horsies?
[01:44:56] Marathon: i'm not an actor -- but i played one on T.V.
[01:48:57] Muttley: There probably are, frijoles
[01:49:06] Muttley: we should start a chess room for chess players who play go
[01:51:31] whatisgo: chess + go = shogi
[01:51:55] Muttley: um,. no
[01:52:40] Nyanjilla: In Japan, pro go players are often strong shogi players, and pro shogi players are often strong go players
[01:53:44] Muttley: Hana got to IM strength and beat some weaker GMs, but I don't know if he still plays chess
[01:54:57] Muttley: Haba sorry
[02:13:55] cekalo: whats up you quarantined nerds
[02:14:24] Ikinasai: ground hog day
[02:14:37] Ikinasai: every day is the same
[02:14:40] cekalo: love that movie
[02:14:55] cekalo: i got you babe ♫
[02:21:10] alfalfa: "don't drive angry"
[02:39:11] Tony2008: ★

[03:11:06] Sh4d0K: RIP dsaun
[03:29:28] PunGent: What trade did Ahnuld take up after he retired from SkyNet?
[03:29:36] PunGent: He became an exterminator.
[03:29:59] Chris: siggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh
[03:30:38] PunGent: Something bugging you?  :-)  Call him, he can help.
[03:31:16] PunGent: And if you get another infestation, he'll be bahk.
[03:31:51] Drosophila: I thought he was working in the Ahpp Stohr?
[03:33:50] bert: he didnt have it easy
[03:34:41] bert: first he discovered he had twin brother in danny devito
[03:35:03] bert: then he became pregnant
[03:36:20] bert: and later he helped at a kindergarten, giving kids some military drill, alegedly they loved it
[03:43:04] alfalfa: then he was the governator... up deah, in sacramento, whea dey ah making alll de laws and dat sort of ting
[03:43:21] Soromon: It's not a tumor.
[03:44:01] Soromon: Seriously though, Total Recall was the best.
[03:44:20] alfalfa: i don't recall
[03:44:31] Soromon: Blue skies over Mars
[03:45:07] alfalfa: i do recall, i was just joking
[03:45:36] Soromon: I know - Blue Skies Over Mars is the name of the virtual vacation he goes on
[03:45:37] PunGent: But were you totally joking?
[03:46:33] alfalfa: like, totally, dude
[03:46:57] PunGent: You heard about the forest amphibians, man?
[03:47:11] Soromon: Poisonous Tree Frogs?
[03:47:19] PunGent: Toadally, man.
[03:47:37] Soromon: Everything is edible at least once.
[03:48:04] PunGent: At least one thing is Oedipal every time.
[03:48:20] Soromon: That might make you croak, though.
[03:48:31] PunGent: Blind, maybe.
[03:48:33] Werfeus: eat me mr. soromon
[03:48:40] Soromon: Nom nom nom nom
[03:48:47] Werfeus: splendid
[03:49:01] Soromon: <burps> needs salk
[03:49:03] Soromon: *salt
[03:49:33] PunGent: Whereas polio did, in fact, need Salk.
[03:50:47] Soromon: I'd say polio was pretty upset about it.
[03:51:06] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLUG7vW0Es
[03:51:39] Soromon: Speaking of movies tho, I just finished a project for all the quarantinees with some extra time to watch good films. https://imgur.com/gallery/11IbB2X
[03:52:19] Werfeus: fair effort
[03:52:47] Soromon: very soothing werfeus, thx
[03:54:31] Werfeus: you follow it
[03:55:58] Soromon: yeah, listening now - i see Audrey Tautou in your profile, I like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films a lot.
[03:56:36] Werfeus: because love prevails everything
[03:56:46] Now: what´s love for you?
[03:56:53] Werfeus: more than most knwo
[03:56:56] Werfeus: know
[03:57:13] Soromon: What is this? Apparently Led Zeppelin mixed with Pink Floyd? I like it.
[03:57:28] alfalfa: what's love got to do (got to do) with it?
[03:57:57] Soromon: groovy
[03:58:29] Werfeus: it's not that simple alfalfa
[03:58:39] alfalfa: Stairway to Gilligan's Island - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTCYLbFxTpI
[03:58:42] PunGent: Pink Zeppelin.
[03:58:43] Werfeus: love prevails and that's what you want to do
[03:59:10] Werfeus: 'which one's you is pink?'
[03:59:29] PunGent: ... what drunk spectators saw at the docking of the Hindenburg.
[04:00:35] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyOg0mt2R2k
[04:01:02] PunGent: ... probably the most horrible piece of newsreel footage ever shot.
[04:01:28] Werfeus: k
[04:02:37] Epsilion: i cooked some meatballs in tomato sauce from scratch the other day
[04:02:41] PunGent: See for yourself.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWeO1q0gHJE
[04:02:48] Epsilion: werf you'd be proud of me
[04:03:34] Soromon: I did something similar - made marinara from scratch for the first time
[04:03:45] Soromon: cooking is wonderful
[04:03:51] Epsilion: nice
[04:03:57] Epsilion: and rewarding
[04:04:35] Soromon: today i made dry-rub chicken wings... i might never go out again now that I know how to make food as good as a restaurant. as long as one doesn't mind cleaning up.
[04:05:32] alfalfa: "marinara" means "sailor-style"
[04:05:49] Werfeus: pepsi you wanker
[04:06:02] alfalfa: in the style of the mariners
[04:09:09] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqZ8428GSrI&
[04:11:46] Soromon: I'm going down a Kingston Wall hole
[04:12:23] YangTze: black hole
[04:15:28] dustdevil: Kingdston
[04:20:24] AmyTS: warble
[04:23:43] Marathon: i went to the grocery store. they are out of sneeze nuts
[04:26:56] AmyTS: oh no
[04:28:07] Soromon: Sneeze nuts?
[04:29:17] alfalfa: cASHEWs
[04:29:53] mongo: :()
[04:31:45] Soromon: Ugh
[04:32:47] alfalfa: pignolio
[04:33:37] Marathon: geshundheit, alf
[04:34:15] Marathon: they had 4 packs of TP, but not a lot. they were also low on soup and pasta
[04:34:46] alfalfa: i bought beer, but that was it, in and out, got home, washed my hands
[04:35:23] Marathon: and i was kidding about the sneeze nuts -- they have those
[04:35:35] alfalfa: i found that i was overly-criticical of my fellow shoppers
[04:35:55] alfalfa: not audibly, nor visibly
[04:35:58] alfalfa: just in my mind
[04:36:48] alfalfa: there were "one-way" signs on the floor.  somebody went to a certain amount of trouble, to put them there
[04:37:17] alfalfa: not only was there a big arrow, but if you could read it said, "one way" and "single file"
[04:37:30] alfalfa: you know, going down the aisles
[04:37:35] alfalfa: and yet...
[04:37:43] alfalfa: almost defiantly...
[04:38:05] alfalfa: people were walking against the posted signs
[04:38:16] alfalfa: so that you had to run into them
[04:38:34] alfalfa: it was like, "what part of co-operating don't you get?"
[04:38:38] momiji: an existential exercise. we eternally try to enforce our own "identity" against the whole which is consciousness
[04:39:30] alfalfa: so i just figured they couldn't read.  why they don't don't know what an arrow means is still a mystery
[04:39:50] alfalfa: but they do the same thing in the parking lot.
[04:39:58] Marathon: an arrow? in grocery stores?  it means they lowered prices!
[04:40:27] momiji: in the grocery store i've actually had people flee from me
[04:40:57] alfalfa: were you going the wrong way down a one-way aisle?
[04:41:57] momiji: no maybe i appeared to be in the vulnerable demographic, while actally being healthy as a horse
[04:42:10] alfalfa: oh, someone has built a fire,it smells wonderful
[04:43:01] alfalfa: the state dept. of natural resources has placede a ban on burning, but i don't think that it includes fireplaces
[04:43:18] alfalfa: more like leaves and stufff
[04:43:26] momiji: what about hobby arson?
[04:43:30] alfalfa: heh
[04:43:35] alfalfa: already a ban on that
[04:44:17] alfalfa: sometimes i can identify the type of wood by the smell
[04:44:57] alfalfa: cedar is the easiest to identify by aroma
[04:45:54] alfalfa: then various conifers, such as pine, fir, spruce... each has a slightly different smell
[04:46:02] momiji: norwegian wood is good
[04:46:08] alfalfa: heh
[04:47:07] alfalfa: deciduous trees too, have specific aromas... hickory, apple
[04:47:16] alfalfa: cherry tree
[04:47:27] alfalfa: it does not smell like cherries though
[04:48:16] momiji: bonsai, for a mini fire
[04:48:24] alfalfa: many people like mesquite for smoking meat
[04:48:49] alfalfa: it has a distinctive sweet aroma and taste
[04:49:20] alfalfa: but hickory, apple, cherry, these are good for smoking bacon
[04:49:55] alfalfa: they don't seem to use conifers to smoke meats
[04:50:08] Soromon: cherry burns hot but doesn't smoke much
[04:50:29] alfalfa: i guess hardwoods are superior to soft
[04:50:45] alfalfa: i dunno
[04:51:26] Werfeus: my wood is superior to most
[04:54:14] zico: There were some trees that smelt so bad at my alma mater. Their smells reminded you of men's bodily fluid
[04:54:40] crazyeight: you act as if that's something that smells terrible
[04:55:23] zico: does it smell pleasant to you?
[04:56:27] crazyeight: normally when you talk about bad smells, garbage and rotten eggs come to mind
[04:56:30] alfalfa: you don't mean when they were burning.  you mean just when they were growing
[04:56:49] alfalfa: where was that college
[04:57:14] alfalfa: i think i know the sort of trees you mean
[04:57:27] zico: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qk97b3/trees-smell-like-vomit-jizz-barf-semen-spring
[04:57:37] crazyeight: I can think of at least half a dozen things that smell absolutely terrible that would've made for a better comparison
[04:57:53] crazyeight: vomit is one of them
[04:57:56] Soromon: some people don't like the smell of Ginko
[04:57:59] Soromon: but the leaves are gorgeous
[04:58:23] zico: yea, gingko tree smells like vomit
[04:58:23] crazyeight: skunks
[04:58:26] crazyeight: road kill
[04:58:46] alfalfa: but where did you attend college?
[04:58:56] zico: i went to a college in midwest
[04:59:01] Soromon: same
[05:01:36] alfalfa: ok, i am not trying to stalk you , i went to northnwestern u. near chicago, then i went to u. of illinois at urbana-champaign
[05:01:47] alfalfa: so that's how i know what you mean
[05:03:00] alfalfa: i have worked for the u. o wisconsin for the last twenty-five years.   but they don't seem to have those bushes here.
[05:03:01] zico: god. that's scary
[05:03:44] alfalfa: maybe we were in classes together
[05:04:36] zico: hahaha
[05:05:21] zico: I went there in early 2010s. you're right, i attended one of those colleges you mentioned
[05:05:36] alfalfa: ah, after i was there
[05:06:04] alfalfa: i moved to wisconsin in 1994
[05:08:56] IamCat: hello everyone i just joined yea
[05:09:06] zico: I visited Madison once. They had a road filled with ginkgo trees at the University. It was near the Chazen Museum. But, they didn't smell like vomit, though
[05:10:55] clydesdale: apparently american porcupines smell of BO
[05:11:22] clydesdale: like old socks
[05:11:28] zico: whose BO? I notice different ethnicity has different BO
[05:12:14] alfalfa: that's diet.
[05:13:15] IamCat: is kgs still going strong ?
[05:13:22] clydesdale: most common cause of death of american porcupines is falling out oftrees
[05:13:31] zico: maybe. But, if I have my eyes closed and smell people's BO, i will know whether they are korean, chinese, japanese, white, or black
[05:13:43] alfalfa: you eat comfort food.  comfort food is what you were raised on. that's what you smell like
[05:14:25] alfalfa: sure, there's a difference, i am only explaining the mechanism
[05:14:35] clydesdale: are you some kind of connoiseur, zico?
[05:14:46] zico: and i'm explaining my hidden talent. hehe
[05:14:52] alfalfa: no he has just made observations
[05:15:12] zico: well, in this case, I'm a BO connoiseur. JK
[05:15:19] alfalfa: japanese say westerners "smell like butter"
[05:15:47] Now: How can I become 8d, zico?
[05:16:23] zico: i'm no 8d. not even close.
[05:17:10] clydesdale: what kind of dog is that in your user info, zico?
[05:17:17] clydesdale: borzoi?
[05:17:54] zico: I haven't heard the borzoi breed. so, I goodled. God. not even close
[05:17:58] zico: it's chow chow
[05:18:51] clydesdale: ah
[05:19:51] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:20:26] alfalfa: Piccalilly Circus
[05:20:50] Epsilion: isn't it piccadilly?
[05:21:09] alfalfa: yes of course
[05:21:16] alfalfa: but
[05:21:48] alfalfa: besides being a breed of dog, "chow-chow" is also the name of a sauce, and that sauce is sometime called....
[05:21:56] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:22:06] alfalfa: which happens to sound like what you said
[05:22:52] Epsilion: i've heard of chow-chow, but didn't know the other name
[05:23:03] Epsilion: green tomatoes?
[05:23:10] zico: I don't even know a sauce named chow chow
[05:23:22] zico: from now on, piccalilly will be my alias
[05:24:01] alfalfa: well, there is another wrinkle... in fact, "green tomatoes" are not tomatoes at all
[05:24:17] alfalfa: not even the ones in "fried green tomatoes"
[05:24:35] Marathon: on of dsaun's rhymes was about troll chow
[05:24:47] alfalfa: they are a different plant, "tomatillo"
[05:25:02] clydesdale: Chows are powerful, compactly built dogs standing as high as 20 inches at the shoulder. Their distinctive traits include a lion’s-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.  Owners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified. They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life.
[05:25:25] Epsilion: ah neat
[05:25:50] Epsilion: what do you serve it with?
[05:25:53] alfalfa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatillo
[05:26:20] Epsilion: here we've served it with fishcakes, which i've always thought was an odd combo
[05:26:43] alfalfa: hmmm something pickled, not too odd
[05:27:13] Epsilion: chow-chow with pickles?
[05:27:30] YangTze: chow mein
[05:29:28] Epsilion: we have pickled herring here
[05:29:37] Epsilion: it's an acquired taste
[05:30:02] Marathon: my dad and i really liked herring in wine sauce
[05:31:06] clydesdale: sounds tasty marathon
[05:32:36] Marathon: it is
[05:34:20] KillerMonk: how do i finish a game if the opponent does not want to accept the result?
[05:35:07] Marathon: if it is a ranked game, contact an admin via private chat.
[05:35:20] KillerMonk: yes ok thanks
[05:35:31] KillerMonk: how do i do that?
[05:35:34] Marathon: edlee, and lelliot are admins, and logged in now.
[05:35:34] KillerMonk: :)
[05:35:46] Marathon: find their names in the list >>>>>>>>>
[05:35:49] Marathon: and click on the name
[05:36:06] Marathon: for future reference, and admin will have 5 point star next to name
[05:36:22] Marathon: yw
[05:39:41] KillerMonk: thanks Marathon
[05:39:55] KillerMonk: just got this resolved . thanks for your help
[05:48:19] DeaconJohn: Hi Amy.  Good to see you.  I've been gone quite a while.
[05:49:10] DeaconJohn: Do you remember when somebody recommended that you get in a friendly group, and, they recommended KGS!
[05:49:35] DeaconJohn: That was quite an honor for us KGSers.
[05:50:32] DeaconJohn: I have not been around for a while, so I'm double glad that you are still here.
[05:51:01] Marathon: yw, monk
[05:51:28] AmyTS: hi
[05:51:50] slb: hi
[05:51:55] DeaconJohn: I'm waiting for a game, so I might disappear unexpectedly.
[05:51:59] slb: https://senseis.xmp.net/?TheRhymesOfDsaun
[05:55:07] Epsilion: i hope someone saved more of them
[05:56:35] slb: yea
[05:57:10] Natalino: hello
[06:05:19] Marathon: so do i.
[06:05:38] Marathon: there was one about troll chow and another about woolymacha
[06:06:29] Marathon: i didn't see the one about apple pie until i saw the tribute page
[06:13:33] AmyTS: i haven't seen wooly in a while
[06:16:41] Marathon: He seems to be rarely on. It's been that way for several years now.
[06:17:12] Marathon: His info says he was here yesterday
[06:18:13] Marathon: dsaun's rhyme has a line about wooly tromping through snow, and ends with something like "ten thousand years of ko"
[06:51:45] GULFOSS: tahoe49 escaper
[06:52:42] Marathon: no public denunciations!   When players leave a game early: http://www.gokgs.com/help/faq/escapers.html  
[06:56:08] slb: No public accusations! Talk to an admin in private if you witness a problem on KGS. Escaper policy: http://www.gokgs.com/help/faq/escapers.html
[06:56:44] slb: the power of copy+paste
[06:58:06] alfalfa: Hallelujah!
[06:58:13] alfalfa: Amen!
[07:09:42] AmyTS: and warble!

[07:45:47] lithograph: does anyone know if EGR chat is archived?
[07:47:00] Eatwisdom: for everyone's sake i hope not
[07:50:43] Marathon: archived how far back?
[07:52:18] lithograph: since its birth ?
[07:52:53] Marathon: no, it's not archived that far back.
[07:53:14] Marathon: a few days, a week or so
[07:53:35] Marathon: why? do you want to recover some of dsaun's rhymes or other sayings?
[07:54:15] lithograph: I really wasn't familar with his poetry.
[07:54:27] lithograph: but that's what prompted my question
[07:54:45] Marathon: too bad we didn't think to save copies ourselves,
[07:55:25] lithograph: i was hoping to purchase a bound copy of the whole chat log, but i guess not possible
[07:58:22] Marathon: your best bet is to look in the games archives
[07:59:03] Marathon: but that's a lot of work.  especially if you are looking for what dsaun said in kibitz
[08:00:27] lithograph: I was imagining an archive of the whole kibitz as being a cool niche historical document
[08:01:16] Marathon: maybe the AGF can make it available.  i
[08:01:24] Marathon: i wonder how much space it takes up?
[08:02:26] lithograph: you think it exists somewhere behind an admin key?
[08:02:47] Marathon: it exists in a KGS server or servers
[08:03:53] lithograph: like all the way back? that's great.
[08:04:41] Marathon: wms used to be able to create a file or something that had all game headers from the archive -- date, time, white player, white rank, black player, black rank, handicap, komi, result -- no moves or chat
[08:05:01] Marathon: he would create it upon request when someone wanted to do some research
[08:07:03] lithograph: i thought game records and .sgfs were accessible, because that kgs analytics site can get them.
[08:07:27] Marathon: they are
[08:09:47] Marathon: almost every game of more than 10 moves played on KGS is there.
[08:10:35] Marathon: there are a few gaps. i assume the gaps are the result of crashes causing corrpution in the archives database.
[08:10:55] lithograph: How would you feel about a site that displayed every day of EGR kibitz? 
[08:11:17] lithograph: Would you think that as somehow intrusive?
[08:14:24] Marathon: i don't know that it would be useful. it would consume resources without good reason
[08:16:44] Marathon: maybe you could write to the AGF, and ask for a copy of the games archive
[08:17:02] Marathon: and then you can mine it for dsaun's chat
[08:17:51] Marathon: he had trouble with his hands late in life, and didn't like to type. so, for his teaching games, he used the microphone.  audio is not recorded in the archives.
[08:19:53] lithograph: i see that he was well liked. 
[08:21:05] lithograph: Thanks for answering my questions, Marathon.  gonna reinitiate 'lurk mode'.
[08:21:05] Marathon: he was indeed.
[08:21:34] Marathon: hmmm -- for some reason, when i try to access his oldest games from the archives, i get a "Forbidden" error
[08:49:15] radishimo: i can't imagine it being intrusive
[08:49:23] radishimo: chat logs are a thing for all sorts of reasons
[08:49:37] radishimo: i'd love to see the time i started an argument by asking maladroit why gravity happens
[08:49:41] radishimo: 5 people were banned
[08:51:06] marzo: oh the good old days
[08:51:46] radishimo: back when chemboy was still around
[08:52:11] radishimo: dsaun and i argued a lot but i liked to think of him as a friend anyway
[08:52:27] radishimo: i am very sad, he was a great guy
[08:52:51] marzo: he was a great guy

[20:06:07] scientia: Hi guys, any c programmer with experience on tcp/ip?
[20:19:43] UTDEspy: Are you talking "Writing a program that does networking" or are you actually talking at the networking layer / driver / embedded level?
[20:25:19] Marathon: the 2020 united states go congress has been canceled.
[20:25:30] Marathon: why did it take so long for them to decide that?
[20:25:46] UTDEspy: The right, sad, decision. A lot of people have been putting things off in the hopes that maybe something, some how would fix things.
[20:26:10] UTDEspy: Some venue holders have cancelation policies that make it extremely expensive so people were waiting until it was literally illegal to have the con, which changes how insurance and stuff manage things
[20:26:44] scientia: writing a program that does networking, just wondering about good resources to learn
[20:27:21] UTDEspy: Oooh, good news Scientia - You probably won't need to actually get into any of the ACTUAL communication. For C you're probably going to want to look up "Sockets"
[20:27:42] UTDEspy: By ACTUAL communication I mean error handling, handshakes, the tcp/ip stuff
[20:27:59] UTDEspy: You'll tend to just get a bitstream that's already been put through that process, so there's More reliability
[20:28:30] scientia: the actual communication seems more interesting now that you said it
[20:29:11] UTDEspy: Hahaha, it's great, and interesting, and I hope you never have to do it
[20:29:21] scientia: but yes I have been reading about sockets
[20:29:38] UTDEspy: As fun it can be a lot of fun to poke around, but actually mucking about at lower levels can be a pain with no gain
[20:29:50] alfalfa: this is the best C code i have ever seen for keeping track of multiple sockets/network connections:
[20:29:53] alfalfa: https://userver.uwaterloo.ca/
[20:30:15] alfalfa: you can learn a lot just by reading that code
[20:30:37] scientia: great! thanks man
[20:30:41] alfalfa: yw
[20:30:58] Equinox: f.a.b.
[20:31:48] scientia: UTDEspy but learning is valuable
[20:32:21] scientia: maybe you have some great read on the lower level stuff?
[20:32:45] UTDEspy: All my lowerlevel stuff was based on the CCNA curriculum ages ago, before, ironically, it was super easy to find good resources online
[20:33:04] UTDEspy: Ran through CCNA and CCNP stuff and paid a ton of attention and it's just rattled around in my head since
[20:34:00] Zahlman: hi espy, good to see you again
[20:34:10] UTDEspy: I'd suggest looking up the OSI 7 Layer Model and TCP/IP handshakes
[20:34:52] UTDEspy: Just about any site talking about that should give you some idea. It helps to think about what levels you're actually touching for framing of the problem space, but also to NOT get too bogged down in what other layers are doing
[20:34:57] alfalfa: mmm, seven-layer dip
[20:35:11] UTDEspy: Hey Zahlman! Yeah, good to be back, it's been too long
[20:35:24] UTDEspy: I'm tryin to do the teaching game thing again
[20:35:31] scientia: nice thanks man

[22:52:00] reduced50: Most of the probems I witness on KGS are my own bad moves
[22:52:07] papaya: shouldn't others beware of these people?
[22:52:23] bolbi: feel free to read the FAQ, papaya
[22:54:26] papaya: seems like a decent system
[22:54:37] kindred: public accusations get old very quickly
[22:54:40] papaya: i mean, escapers are eventually punished after 6 months
[22:54:58] bolbi: before 6 months
[22:55:25] kindred: 10 or so games escaped, before they start to forfeit the games
[22:55:44] bolbi: sometimes, they lose as soon as they escape
[22:55:53] kindred: yes
[22:55:57] Now: jeez 8 victories in a row and still my rank doesn´t go up
[22:56:26] papaya: probably just need one more!

[22:56:33] regularfit: years ago i had 41 vitories in a row without promoting
[22:56:36] regularfit: no joke
[22:57:41] Now: that´s bad
[22:58:18] regularfit: thats due to the broad time window of weighted average they have here
[23:03:53] JY0034: who are the admins?
[23:04:36] kindred: they're the ones with five pointed star next to their name

[00:17:19] Eliza: not really
[00:17:27] N9DP: Not supported   only Android
[00:17:59] Eliza: there is an HTML version, but....
[00:18:10] Padre: Ok thanks. That's a headscratcher. Must be something technical?...
[00:18:26] alfalfa: no, social.
[00:18:47] alfalfa: Apple refuses to support Java, just out of spite and malice.
[00:19:09] alfalfa: so that's the reason we can't have nice things
[00:19:17] Eliza: mind you.... Java does suck
[00:19:24] alfalfa: no it doesn't
[00:19:30] Padre: Oh I see. Walled garden
[00:19:37] Marathon: so what?  what's needed isn't necessarily java support. what's needed is a common protocol.

[00:22:16] nonosse: i m on a mac

[00:57:37] Eliza: my birthday....
[00:58:32] LGSam: Most of us only found out on April 11th
[00:58:55] LGSam: so we had been hoping and hoping for a while after it already happened
[00:58:55] radishimo: this is the first time it's been someone i knew at all on any level
[00:59:17] LGSam: What? Death? Death caused by COVID?
[00:59:27] radishimo: death by the virus
[00:59:49] LGSam: i see
[00:59:53] radishimo: i've had death in my own life personally but never from something so stupidly preventable
[01:00:34] LGSam: This is the first time I've had a friend from KGS die because of COVID
[01:01:18] radishimo: i've spoken with people that have had acquintances die from it but it's always been second hand
[01:01:21] LGSam: but the second by a different illness, and the third total

[01:06:51] LGSam: guess why
[01:07:04] radishimo: so yeah after the poop hit the fan things got busier for us and i'm just tired from all the work
[01:07:09] zico: why? because of the pandemic?
[01:07:29] radishimo: but hey i've lost 12 pounds because we can't eat out any more!
[01:07:36] radishimo: 25 more to go...
[01:07:51] Eliza: I've lost weight because I can't go out to buy more chocolate
[01:08:12] JIeBuc: I probably need to lose 20 pounds too
[01:08:18] zico: funny you said that because I actually gained more weight because I couldn't go hiking and do outdoor activities
[01:08:50] VIXX: (dark chocolate actually helps lose weight haha)
[01:08:51] radishimo: eating healthier and less
[01:09:04] Eliza: milk chocolat.... Cadburys
[01:09:13] Epsilion: i'm addcited to dark chocolate almonds lately
[01:09:57] JIeBuc: Well, it's not hard to lose weight, just takes time and a little bit of efforts
[01:10:08] Eliza: simple
[01:10:19] beerslayer: simple vs hard
[01:10:28] beerslayer: *simple vs easy
[01:10:31] Now: six-pack
[01:10:40] cronin: what happened to my chat screen %(
[01:10:55] Now: I think with a couple of beers my moves are gonna be bolder
[01:11:15] radishimo: i used to black out on ativan and blitz
[01:11:19] cronin: JB, the MD has spoken
[01:11:30] radishimo: i think my record was 31 games in a day?
[01:11:50] radishimo: don't do benzos, kids
[01:11:54] cronin: how many losses? XD
[01:12:00] Now: lol
[01:12:17] radishimo: i dunno i started at 30k and got to 1d here a few years later
[01:12:26] radishimo: so i won enough
[01:12:29] cronin: reminds me when Bart Simpson tries to be smart and takes up chess and he does a simul
[01:12:40] cronin: cut scene, after the games end and he lost all of them!
[01:13:14] cronin: ah, bragging - the telltale sign of an insecure personality
[01:13:47] radishimo: hey guys, everyone pay attention to the guy trying to pick a fight
[01:13:54] radishimo: what would you like to talk about, cronin
[01:14:21] afgani: only corona talk
[01:14:38] Now: here on Spain the government just said till 9 of may
[01:14:49] Now: so a lot of Go to play
[01:15:00] radishimo: it's too early
[01:15:09] radishimo: there will be a resurgence
[01:15:11] Now: more go even then
[01:15:17] radishimo: can't do anything to stop it, this is so sad
[01:16:26] Now: this is all the age of aquarius, energy has changed, new circle
[01:18:41] radishimo: why is saying what rank you are or were automatically bragging anyway
[01:18:47] VIXX: 9 of may will still be early stage yeah.. no doubt politicians will come forward touting a flattening curve, but indeed a resurgence will lurk for times to come
[01:19:02] radishimo: if anything it's a commentary on how i'm weaker now than i was then
[01:19:38] Now: it doesn´t matter, just play
[01:19:48] VIXX: i honestly don't see how that constitutes bragging either
[01:19:50] VIXX: haha
[01:20:13] radishimo: yeah like
[01:20:19] afgani: cronin  is jealous
[01:20:31] radishimo: "look at this 2k player bragging that he got to 1d, haha he thinks he's so good"
[01:20:38] radishimo: let's take a step back and look at that statement
[01:20:45] Now: I didn´t even think about that
[01:21:05] Now: in fact, I liked your statement of getting to 1d blacking out
[01:21:17] radishimo: like if i wasn't humble about that crap wouldn't i like.. not want to tell people i used to be ranked higher?
[01:21:27] radishimo: because the lower rank would be embarassing?
[01:21:32] radishimo: am i off base thinking that?
[01:21:54] radishimo: i wasn't in a good place and go still made me happy, that's kinda the point of what i was saying
[01:25:32] cronin: i think this conversation is getting really low class, and afgani, shut up, as you can't speak for me
[01:25:49] cronin: but i'm glad if you two found in each other a friend
[01:25:57] LGSam: I think
[01:26:14] LGSam: I think we should appreciate the fact that we are still here
[01:26:26] radishimo: look at the guy who wanted attention trying to highroad us now
[01:26:44] VIXX: hahaha, yeah, that wasn't pompous at all
[01:26:53] VIXX: none noticed lol
[01:27:06] radishimo: yes your internet philosophy is such an example on how we should cast aside mortal  considerations and think about bigger things
[01:27:38] radishimo: nevermind you started the whole thing with "hurrdurr did you lose a lot"
[01:29:41] Now: easily triggered
[01:30:04] Padre: again on the client for IOS thread I started earlier in this room - a KGS user pointed me to this: shin.gokgs.com.  I loaded it on an ipad in safari, was able to login and tried some game play. Worked really well!
[01:30:16] Padre: Does anyone else use that client?
[01:30:41] Muttley: I don't know how to
[01:30:44] Eliza: I tried it.... but it was so slow on my elderly ipad
[01:31:00] Muttley: It said I had to put an extension on chrome or something
[01:31:02] Padre: sounds like you need a relatively new/fast ipad...
[01:31:17] Muttley: so I did, but I didn't know what to do next :))
[01:31:20] Eliza: no... I don't need one.... this works
[01:31:25] Padre: I just loaded that URL in safari. Logged in and got going
[01:31:41] SimeonG: I'm using it right now, no extension needed
[01:31:53] Muttley: Well, Fredda vs Werfeus
[01:31:56] Muttley: watch that instead :)
[01:32:02] Padre: so no need for a native OSX client after all?... :-)
[01:32:48] Padre: I found one thing I didn't like - which is how you can hover over a point and see where the stone will actually drop when you click. Not working in the shin client
[01:33:03] Padre: you touch and hope your grubby finger tip is lined up on the right point :-)
[01:33:39] Padre: touch once and touch again to confirm as an option? 
[01:33:51] Padre: I guess I should ping the developer...
[01:34:39] nonosse: i use that too, just miss a few functionality but works well
[01:34:58] Padre: there's an email feedback link in the client to jkkramer@... anyone here know this person?  I would like to thank them :-)
[01:35:26] afgani: is  it true  that sushi is  really cheap in japan?
[01:35:35] nonosse: you can check on L19 forum
[01:36:11] Eliza: kaiten zushi is cheap
[01:36:42] afgani: whats that?
[01:36:49] radishimo: the conveyor belt
[01:36:56] radishimo: where they charge you per plate
[01:37:03] afgani: how much?
[01:37:05] radishimo: kaiten means rotate
[01:37:28] radishimo: it depends on the quality of place but it can be pretty stupid cheap as far as sushi goes
[01:39:41] frijoles: Any 1800 chess players here?
[01:40:56] afgani: no  c word in  the EGR
[01:42:31] VIXX: *raises hand*
[01:43:04] Eliza: don't worry.... we won't hold it against you
[01:44:24] Marathon: chess? is that the game with the horsies?
[01:44:56] Marathon: i'm not an actor -- but i played one on T.V.
[01:48:57] Muttley: There probably are, frijoles
[01:49:06] Muttley: we should start a chess room for chess players who play go
[01:51:31] whatisgo: chess + go = shogi
[01:51:55] Muttley: um,. no
[01:52:40] Nyanjilla: In Japan, pro go players are often strong shogi players, and pro shogi players are often strong go players
[01:53:44] Muttley: Hana got to IM strength and beat some weaker GMs, but I don't know if he still plays chess
[01:54:57] Muttley: Haba sorry
[02:13:55] cekalo: whats up you quarantined nerds
[02:14:24] Ikinasai: ground hog day

[03:29:36] PunGent: He became an exterminator.

[03:30:38] PunGent: Something bugging you?  :-)  Call him, he can help.
[03:31:16] PunGent: And if you get another infestation, he'll be bahk.
[03:31:51] Drosophila: I thought he was working in the Ahpp Stohr?
[03:33:50] bert: he didnt have it easy
[03:34:41] bert: first he discovered he had twin brother in danny devito
[03:35:03] bert: then he became pregnant
[03:36:20] bert: and later he helped at a kindergarten, giving kids some military drill, alegedly they loved it
[03:43:04] alfalfa: then he was the governator... up deah, in sacramento, whea dey ah making alll de laws and dat sort of ting
[03:43:21] Soromon: It's not a tumor.
[03:44:01] Soromon: Seriously though, Total Recall was the best.
[03:44:20] alfalfa: i don't recall
[03:44:31] Soromon: Blue skies over Mars
[03:45:07] alfalfa: i do recall, i was just joking
[03:45:36] Soromon: I know - Blue Skies Over Mars is the name of the virtual vacation he goes on
[03:45:37] PunGent: But were you totally joking?
[03:46:33] alfalfa: like, totally, dude
[03:46:57] PunGent: You heard about the forest amphibians, man?
[03:47:11] Soromon: Poisonous Tree Frogs?
[03:47:19] PunGent: Toadally, man.
[03:47:37] Soromon: Everything is edible at least once.
[03:48:04] PunGent: At least one thing is Oedipal every time.
[03:48:20] Soromon: That might make you croak, though.
[03:48:31] PunGent: Blind, maybe.
[03:48:33] Werfeus: eat me mr. soromon
[03:48:40] Soromon: Nom nom nom nom
[03:48:47] Werfeus: splendid
[03:49:01] Soromon: <burps> needs salk
[03:49:03] Soromon: *salt
[03:49:33] PunGent: Whereas polio did, in fact, need Salk.
[03:50:47] Soromon: I'd say polio was pretty upset about it.
[03:51:06] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLUG7vW0Es
[03:51:39] Soromon: Speaking of movies tho, I just finished a project for all the quarantinees with some extra time to watch good films. https://imgur.com/gallery/11IbB2X
[03:52:19] Werfeus: fair effort
[03:52:47] Soromon: very soothing werfeus, thx
[03:54:31] Werfeus: you follow it
[03:55:58] Soromon: yeah, listening now - i see Audrey Tautou in your profile, I like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films a lot.
[03:56:36] Werfeus: because love prevails everything
[03:56:46] Now: what´s love for you?
[03:56:53] Werfeus: more than most knwo
[03:56:56] Werfeus: know
[03:57:13] Soromon: What is this? Apparently Led Zeppelin mixed with Pink Floyd? I like it.
[03:57:28] alfalfa: what's love got to do (got to do) with it?
[03:57:57] Soromon: groovy
[03:58:29] Werfeus: it's not that simple alfalfa
[03:58:39] alfalfa: Stairway to Gilligan's Island - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTCYLbFxTpI
[03:58:42] PunGent: Pink Zeppelin.
[03:58:43] Werfeus: love prevails and that's what you want to do
[03:59:10] Werfeus: 'which one's you is pink?'
[03:59:29] PunGent: ... what drunk spectators saw at the docking of the Hindenburg.
[04:00:35] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyOg0mt2R2k
[04:01:02] PunGent: ... probably the most horrible piece of newsreel footage ever shot.
[04:01:28] Werfeus: k
[04:02:37] Epsilion: i cooked some meatballs in tomato sauce from scratch the other day
[04:02:41] PunGent: See for yourself.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWeO1q0gHJE
[04:02:48] Epsilion: werf you'd be proud of me
[04:03:34] Soromon: I did something similar - made marinara from scratch for the first time
[04:03:45] Soromon: cooking is wonderful
[04:03:51] Epsilion: nice
[04:03:57] Epsilion: and rewarding
[04:04:35] Soromon: today i made dry-rub chicken wings... i might never go out again now that I know how to make food as good as a restaurant. as long as one doesn't mind cleaning up.
[04:05:32] alfalfa: "marinara" means "sailor-style"
[04:05:49] Werfeus: pepsi you wanker
[04:06:02] alfalfa: in the style of the mariners
[04:09:09] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqZ8428GSrI&
[04:11:46] Soromon: I'm going down a Kingston Wall hole
[04:12:23] YangTze: black hole
[04:15:28] dustdevil: Kingdston
[04:20:24] AmyTS: warble
[04:23:43] Marathon: i went to the grocery store. they are out of sneeze nuts
[04:26:56] AmyTS: oh no
[04:28:07] Soromon: Sneeze nuts?
[04:29:17] alfalfa: cASHEWs
[04:29:53] mongo: :()
[04:31:45] Soromon: Ugh
[04:32:47] alfalfa: pignolio
[04:33:37] Marathon: geshundheit, alf
[04:34:15] Marathon: they had 4 packs of TP, but not a lot. they were also low on soup and pasta
[04:34:46] alfalfa: i bought beer, but that was it, in and out, got home, washed my hands
[04:35:23] Marathon: and i was kidding about the sneeze nuts -- they have those
[04:35:35] alfalfa: i found that i was overly-criticical of my fellow shoppers
[04:35:55] alfalfa: not audibly, nor visibly
[04:35:58] alfalfa: just in my mind
[04:36:48] alfalfa: there were "one-way" signs on the floor.  somebody went to a certain amount of trouble, to put them there
[04:37:17] alfalfa: not only was there a big arrow, but if you could read it said, "one way" and "single file"
[04:37:30] alfalfa: you know, going down the aisles
[04:37:35] alfalfa: and yet...
[04:37:43] alfalfa: almost defiantly...
[04:38:05] alfalfa: people were walking against the posted signs
[04:38:16] alfalfa: so that you had to run into them
[04:38:34] alfalfa: it was like, "what part of co-operating don't you get?"
[04:38:38] momiji: an existential exercise. we eternally try to enforce our own "identity" against the whole which is consciousness
[04:39:30] alfalfa: so i just figured they couldn't read.  why they don't don't know what an arrow means is still a mystery
[04:39:50] alfalfa: but they do the same thing in the parking lot.
[04:39:58] Marathon: an arrow? in grocery stores?  it means they lowered prices!
[04:40:27] momiji: in the grocery store i've actually had people flee from me
[04:40:57] alfalfa: were you going the wrong way down a one-way aisle?
[04:41:57] momiji: no maybe i appeared to be in the vulnerable demographic, while actally being healthy as a horse
[04:42:10] alfalfa: oh, someone has built a fire,it smells wonderful
[04:43:01] alfalfa: the state dept. of natural resources has placede a ban on burning, but i don't think that it includes fireplaces
[04:43:18] alfalfa: more like leaves and stufff
[04:43:26] momiji: what about hobby arson?
[04:43:30] alfalfa: heh
[04:43:35] alfalfa: already a ban on that
[04:44:17] alfalfa: sometimes i can identify the type of wood by the smell
[04:44:57] alfalfa: cedar is the easiest to identify by aroma
[04:45:54] alfalfa: then various conifers, such as pine, fir, spruce... each has a slightly different smell
[04:46:02] momiji: norwegian wood is good
[04:46:08] alfalfa: heh
[04:47:07] alfalfa: deciduous trees too, have specific aromas... hickory, apple
[04:47:16] alfalfa: cherry tree
[04:47:27] alfalfa: it does not smell like cherries though
[04:48:16] momiji: bonsai, for a mini fire
[04:48:24] alfalfa: many people like mesquite for smoking meat
[04:48:49] alfalfa: it has a distinctive sweet aroma and taste
[04:49:20] alfalfa: but hickory, apple, cherry, these are good for smoking bacon
[04:49:55] alfalfa: they don't seem to use conifers to smoke meats
[04:50:08] Soromon: cherry burns hot but doesn't smoke much
[04:50:29] alfalfa: i guess hardwoods are superior to soft
[04:50:45] alfalfa: i dunno
[04:51:26] Werfeus: my wood is superior to most
[04:54:14] zico: There were some trees that smelt so bad at my alma mater. Their smells reminded you of men's bodily fluid
[04:54:40] crazyeight: you act as if that's something that smells terrible
[04:55:23] zico: does it smell pleasant to you?
[04:56:27] crazyeight: normally when you talk about bad smells, garbage and rotten eggs come to mind
[04:56:30] alfalfa: you don't mean when they were burning.  you mean just when they were growing
[04:56:49] alfalfa: where was that college
[04:57:14] alfalfa: i think i know the sort of trees you mean
[04:57:27] zico: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qk97b3/trees-smell-like-vomit-jizz-barf-semen-spring
[04:57:37] crazyeight: I can think of at least half a dozen things that smell absolutely terrible that would've made for a better comparison
[04:57:53] crazyeight: vomit is one of them
[04:57:56] Soromon: some people don't like the smell of Ginko
[04:57:59] Soromon: but the leaves are gorgeous
[04:58:23] zico: yea, gingko tree smells like vomit
[04:58:23] crazyeight: skunks
[04:58:26] crazyeight: road kill
[04:58:46] alfalfa: but where did you attend college?
[04:58:56] zico: i went to a college in midwest
[04:59:01] Soromon: same
[05:01:36] alfalfa: ok, i am not trying to stalk you , i went to northnwestern u. near chicago, then i went to u. of illinois at urbana-champaign
[05:01:47] alfalfa: so that's how i know what you mean
[05:03:00] alfalfa: i have worked for the u. o wisconsin for the last twenty-five years.   but they don't seem to have those bushes here.
[05:03:01] zico: god. that's scary
[05:03:44] alfalfa: maybe we were in classes together
[05:04:36] zico: hahaha
[05:05:21] zico: I went there in early 2010s. you're right, i attended one of those colleges you mentioned
[05:05:36] alfalfa: ah, after i was there
[05:06:04] alfalfa: i moved to wisconsin in 1994
[05:08:56] IamCat: hello everyone i just joined yea
[05:09:06] zico: I visited Madison once. They had a road filled with ginkgo trees at the University. It was near the Chazen Museum. But, they didn't smell like vomit, though
[05:10:55] clydesdale: apparently american porcupines smell of BO
[05:11:22] clydesdale: like old socks
[05:11:28] zico: whose BO? I notice different ethnicity has different BO
[05:12:14] alfalfa: that's diet.
[05:13:15] IamCat: is kgs still going strong ?
[05:13:22] clydesdale: most common cause of death of american porcupines is falling out oftrees
[05:13:31] zico: maybe. But, if I have my eyes closed and smell people's BO, i will know whether they are korean, chinese, japanese, white, or black
[05:13:43] alfalfa: you eat comfort food.  comfort food is what you were raised on. that's what you smell like
[05:14:25] alfalfa: sure, there's a difference, i am only explaining the mechanism
[05:14:35] clydesdale: are you some kind of connoiseur, zico?
[05:14:46] zico: and i'm explaining my hidden talent. hehe
[05:14:52] alfalfa: no he has just made observations
[05:15:12] zico: well, in this case, I'm a BO connoiseur. JK
[05:15:19] alfalfa: japanese say westerners "smell like butter"
[05:15:47] Now: How can I become 8d, zico?
[05:16:23] zico: i'm no 8d. not even close.
[05:17:10] clydesdale: what kind of dog is that in your user info, zico?
[05:17:17] clydesdale: borzoi?
[05:17:54] zico: I haven't heard the borzoi breed. so, I goodled. God. not even close
[05:17:58] zico: it's chow chow
[05:18:51] clydesdale: ah
[05:19:51] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:20:26] alfalfa: Piccalilly Circus
[05:20:50] Epsilion: isn't it piccadilly?
[05:21:09] alfalfa: yes of course
[05:21:16] alfalfa: but
[05:21:48] alfalfa: besides being a breed of dog, "chow-chow" is also the name of a sauce, and that sauce is sometime called....
[05:21:56] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:22:06] alfalfa: which happens to sound like what you said
[05:22:52] Epsilion: i've heard of chow-chow, but didn't know the other name
[05:23:03] Epsilion: green tomatoes?
[05:23:10] zico: I don't even know a sauce named chow chow
[05:23:22] zico: from now on, piccalilly will be my alias
[05:24:01] alfalfa: well, there is another wrinkle... in fact, "green tomatoes" are not tomatoes at all
[05:24:17] alfalfa: not even the ones in "fried green tomatoes"
[05:24:35] Marathon: on of dsaun's rhymes was about troll chow
[05:24:47] alfalfa: they are a different plant, "tomatillo"
[05:25:02] clydesdale: Chows are powerful, compactly built dogs standing as high as 20 inches at the shoulder. Their distinctive traits include a lion’s-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.  Owners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified. They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life.
[05:25:25] Epsilion: ah neat
[05:25:50] Epsilion: what do you serve it with?
[05:25:53] alfalfa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatillo
[05:26:20] Epsilion: here we've served it with fishcakes, which i've always thought was an odd combo
[05:26:43] alfalfa: hmmm something pickled, not too odd
[05:27:13] Epsilion: chow-chow with pickles?
[05:27:30] YangTze: chow mein
[05:29:28] Epsilion: we have pickled herring here
[05:29:37] Epsilion: it's an acquired taste
[05:30:02] Marathon: my dad and i really liked herring in wine sauce
[05:31:06] clydesdale: sounds tasty marathon
[05:32:36] Marathon: it is
[05:34:20] KillerMonk: how do i finish a game if the opponent does not want to accept the result?
[05:35:07] Marathon: if it is a ranked game, contact an admin via private chat.
[05:35:20] KillerMonk: yes ok thanks
[05:35:31] KillerMonk: how do i do that?
[05:35:34] Marathon: edlee, and lelliot are admins, and logged in now.
[05:35:34] KillerMonk: :)
[05:35:46] Marathon: find their names in the list >>>>>>>>>
[05:35:49] Marathon: and click on the name
[05:36:06] Marathon: for future reference, and admin will have 5 point star next to name
[05:36:22] Marathon: yw
[05:39:41] KillerMonk: thanks Marathon
[05:39:55] KillerMonk: just got this resolved . thanks for your help
[05:48:19] DeaconJohn: Hi Amy.  Good to see you.  I've been gone quite a while.
[05:49:10] DeaconJohn: Do you remember when somebody recommended that you get in a friendly group, and, they recommended KGS!
[05:49:35] DeaconJohn: That was quite an honor for us KGSers.
[05:50:32] DeaconJohn: I have not been around for a while, so I'm double glad that you are still here.
[05:51:01] Marathon: yw, monk
[05:51:28] AmyTS: hi
[05:51:50] slb: hi
[05:51:55] DeaconJohn: I'm waiting for a game, so I might disappear unexpectedly.
[05:51:59] slb: https://senseis.xmp.net/?TheRhymesOfDsaun
[05:55:07] Epsilion: i hope someone saved more of them
[05:56:35] slb: yea
[05:57:10] Natalino: hello
[06:05:19] Marathon: so do i.
[06:05:38] Marathon: there was one about troll chow and another about woolymacha
[06:06:29] Marathon: i didn't see the one about apple pie until i saw the tribute page
[06:13:33] AmyTS: i haven't seen wooly in a while
[06:16:41] Marathon: He seems to be rarely on. It's been that way for several years now.
[06:17:12] Marathon: His info says he was here yesterday
[06:18:13] Marathon: dsaun's rhyme has a line about wooly tromping through snow, and ends with something like "ten thousand years of ko"
[06:51:45] GULFOSS: tahoe49 escaper
[06:52:42] Marathon: no public denunciations!   When players leave a game early: http://www.gokgs.com/help/faq/escapers.html  
[06:56:08] slb: No public accusations! Talk to an admin in private if you witness a problem on KGS. Escaper policy: http://www.gokgs.com/help/faq/escapers.html
[06:56:44] slb: the power of copy+paste
[06:58:06] alfalfa: Hallelujah!
[06:58:13] alfalfa: Amen!
[07:09:42] AmyTS: and warble!
[07:22:10] Goeland: Ramen
[07:45:47] lithograph: does anyone know if EGR chat is archived?
[07:47:00] Eatwisdom: for everyone's sake i hope not
[07:50:43] Marathon: archived how far back?
[07:52:18] lithograph: since its birth ?
[07:52:53] Marathon: no, it's not archived that far back.
[07:53:14] Marathon: a few days, a week or so
[07:53:35] Marathon: why? do you want to recover some of dsaun's rhymes or other sayings?
[07:54:15] lithograph: I really wasn't familar with his poetry.
[07:54:27] lithograph: but that's what prompted my question
[07:54:45] Marathon: too bad we didn't think to save copies ourselves,
[07:55:25] lithograph: i was hoping to purchase a bound copy of the whole chat log, but i guess not possible
[07:58:22] Marathon: your best bet is to look in the games archives
[07:59:03] Marathon: but that's a lot of work.  especially if you are looking for what dsaun said in kibitz
[08:00:27] lithograph: I was imagining an archive of the whole kibitz as being a cool niche historical document
[08:01:16] Marathon: maybe the AGF can make it available.  i
[08:01:24] Marathon: i wonder how much space it takes up?
[08:02:26] lithograph: you think it exists somewhere behind an admin key?
[08:02:47] Marathon: it exists in a KGS server or servers
[08:03:53] lithograph: like all the way back? that's great.
[08:04:41] Marathon: wms used to be able to create a file or something that had all game headers from the archive -- date, time, white player, white rank, black player, black rank, handicap, komi, result -- no moves or chat
[08:05:01] Marathon: he would create it upon request when someone wanted to do some research
[08:07:03] lithograph: i thought game records and .sgfs were accessible, because that kgs analytics site can get them.
[08:07:27] Marathon: they are
[08:09:47] Marathon: almost every game of more than 10 moves played on KGS is there.
[08:10:35] Marathon: there are a few gaps. i assume the gaps are the result of crashes causing corrpution in the archives database.
[08:10:55] lithograph: How would you feel about a site that displayed every day of EGR kibitz? 
[08:11:17] lithograph: Would you think that as somehow intrusive?
[08:14:24] Marathon: i don't know that it would be useful. it would consume resources without good reason
[08:16:44] Marathon: maybe you could write to the AGF, and ask for a copy of the games archive
[08:17:02] Marathon: and then you can mine it for dsaun's chat
[08:17:51] Marathon: he had trouble with his hands late in life, and didn't like to type. so, for his teaching games, he used the microphone.  audio is not recorded in the archives.
[08:19:53] lithograph: i see that he was well liked. 
[08:21:05] lithograph: Thanks for answering my questions, Marathon.  gonna reinitiate 'lurk mode'.
[08:21:05] Marathon: he was indeed.
[08:21:34] Marathon: hmmm -- for some reason, when i try to access his oldest games from the archives, i get a "Forbidden" error
[08:49:15] radishimo: i can't imagine it being intrusive
[08:49:23] radishimo: chat logs are a thing for all sorts of reasons
[08:49:37] radishimo: i'd love to see the time i started an argument by asking maladroit why gravity happens
[08:49:41] radishimo: 5 people were banned
[08:51:06] marzo: oh the good old days
[08:51:46] radishimo: back when chemboy was still around
[08:52:11] radishimo: dsaun and i argued a lot but i liked to think of him as a friend anyway
[08:52:27] radishimo: i am very sad, he was a great guy

[20:06:07] scientia: Hi guys, any c programmer with experience on tcp/ip?
[20:19:43] UTDEspy: Are you talking "Writing a program that does networking" or are you actually talking at the networking layer / driver / embedded level?
[20:25:19] Marathon: the 2020 united states go congress has been canceled.
[20:25:30] Marathon: why did it take so long for them to decide that?
[20:25:46] UTDEspy: The right, sad, decision. A lot of people have been putting things off in the hopes that maybe something, some how would fix things.
[20:26:10] UTDEspy: Some venue holders have cancelation policies that make it extremely expensive so people were waiting until it was literally illegal to have the con, which changes how insurance and stuff manage things
[20:26:44] scientia: writing a program that does networking, just wondering about good resources to learn
[20:27:21] UTDEspy: Oooh, good news Scientia - You probably won't need to actually get into any of the ACTUAL communication. For C you're probably going to want to look up "Sockets"
[20:27:42] UTDEspy: By ACTUAL communication I mean error handling, handshakes, the tcp/ip stuff
[20:27:59] UTDEspy: You'll tend to just get a bitstream that's already been put through that process, so there's More reliability
[20:28:30] scientia: the actual communication seems more interesting now that you said it
[20:29:11] UTDEspy: Hahaha, it's great, and interesting, and I hope you never have to do it
[20:29:21] scientia: but yes I have been reading about sockets
[20:29:38] UTDEspy: As fun it can be a lot of fun to poke around, but actually mucking about at lower levels can be a pain with no gain
[20:29:50] alfalfa: this is the best C code i have ever seen for keeping track of multiple sockets/network connections:
[20:29:53] alfalfa: https://userver.uwaterloo.ca/
[20:30:15] alfalfa: you can learn a lot just by reading that code
[20:30:37] scientia: great! thanks man
[20:30:41] alfalfa: yw
[20:30:58] Equinox: f.a.b.
[20:31:48] scientia: UTDEspy but learning is valuable
[20:32:21] scientia: maybe you have some great read on the lower level stuff?
[20:32:45] UTDEspy: All my lowerlevel stuff was based on the CCNA curriculum ages ago, before, ironically, it was super easy to find good resources online
[20:33:04] UTDEspy: Ran through CCNA and CCNP stuff and paid a ton of attention and it's just rattled around in my head since
[20:34:00] Zahlman: hi espy, good to see you again
[20:34:10] UTDEspy: I'd suggest looking up the OSI 7 Layer Model and TCP/IP handshakes
[20:34:52] UTDEspy: Just about any site talking about that should give you some idea. It helps to think about what levels you're actually touching for framing of the problem space, but also to NOT get too bogged down in what other layers are doing
[20:34:57] alfalfa: mmm, seven-layer dip
[20:35:11] UTDEspy: Hey Zahlman! Yeah, good to be back, it's been too long
[20:35:24] UTDEspy: I'm tryin to do the teaching game thing again
[20:35:31] scientia: nice thanks man

[22:45:11] knockknock: so sad for 3D level
[22:48:47] knockknock: how to contact admin? no replay
[22:51:57] papaya: i never understood why we couldn't publicly accuse selfish players
[22:52:00] reduced50: Most of the probems I witness on KGS are my own bad moves
[22:52:07] papaya: shouldn't others beware of these people?
[22:52:23] bolbi: feel free to read the FAQ, papaya
[22:54:26] papaya: seems like a decent system
[22:54:37] kindred: public accusations get old very quickly
[22:54:40] papaya: i mean, escapers are eventually punished after 6 months
[22:54:58] bolbi: before 6 months
[22:55:25] kindred: 10 or so games escaped, before they start to forfeit the games
[22:55:44] bolbi: sometimes, they lose as soon as they escape
[22:55:53] kindred: yes
[22:55:57] Now: jeez 8 victories in a row and still my rank doesn´t go up
[22:56:26] papaya: probably just need one more!
[22:56:30] Now: uh no, I lost one yesterday
[22:56:33] regularfit: years ago i had 41 vitories in a row without promoting
[22:56:36] regularfit: no joke
[22:57:41] Now: that´s bad
[22:58:18] regularfit: thats due to the broad time window of weighted average they have here
[23:03:53] JY0034: who are the admins?
[23:04:36] kindred: they're the ones with five pointed star next to their name
[23:04:51] bolbi: we have a gold or a silver star next to our name

[00:16:56] Padre: I just searched for latest on KGS client options for IOS (iPad/iPhone). I couldn't find anything. Am I missing something?
[00:17:19] Eliza: not really
[00:17:27] N9DP: Not supported   only Android
[00:17:59] Eliza: there is an HTML version, but....
[00:18:10] Padre: Ok thanks. That's a headscratcher. Must be something technical?...
[00:18:26] alfalfa: no, social.
[00:18:47] alfalfa: Apple refuses to support Java, just out of spite and malice.
[00:19:09] alfalfa: so that's the reason we can't have nice things
[00:19:17] Eliza: mind you.... Java does suck
[00:19:24] alfalfa: no it doesn't
[00:19:30] Padre: Oh I see. Walled garden
[00:19:37] Marathon: so what?  what's needed isn't necessarily java support. what's needed is a common protocol.
[00:22:03] nonosse: i mon amac
[00:22:16] nonosse: i m on a mac
[00:22:30] arndt: someone who knows how could write a client for Iphone

[00:57:02] LGSam: I didn't but I knew him fairly well
[00:57:37] Eliza: my birthday....
[00:58:32] LGSam: Most of us only found out on April 11th
[00:58:55] LGSam: so we had been hoping and hoping for a while after it already happened
[00:58:55] radishimo: this is the first time it's been someone i knew at all on any level
[00:59:17] LGSam: What? Death? Death caused by COVID?
[00:59:27] radishimo: death by the virus
[00:59:49] LGSam: i see
[00:59:53] radishimo: i've had death in my own life personally but never from something so stupidly preventable
[01:00:34] LGSam: This is the first time I've had a friend from KGS die because of COVID
[01:01:18] radishimo: i've spoken with people that have had acquintances die from it but it's always been second hand
[01:01:21] LGSam: but the second by a different illness, and the third total
[01:01:47] radishimo: my wife teaches chinese kids english online
[01:01:53] radishimo: this started in november

[01:05:01] radishimo: of all the things to spam, an obscure go server with a few hundred people on it
[01:05:03] Nyanjilla: anyone else want a vacatioin?
[01:05:21] radishimo: yeah, i'm ready to take a break for a few weeks
[01:05:35] Chris: How about a cruise?
[01:05:41] zico: lol
[01:05:43] LGSam: I'm on vacation, but it's going to be kind of hard to enjoy now...
[01:05:46] lelliot: hey, we're at 1007 :)
[01:05:47] grooveman: hello
[01:05:53] Muttley: You banned him too, Ny?

[01:06:49] LGSam: @lelliot We've been hitting 1000+ near daily for the past month or so
[01:06:51] LGSam: guess why
[01:07:04] radishimo: so yeah after the poop hit the fan things got busier for us and i'm just tired from all the work
[01:07:09] zico: why? because of the pandemic?
[01:07:29] radishimo: but hey i've lost 12 pounds because we can't eat out any more!
[01:07:36] radishimo: 25 more to go...
[01:07:51] Eliza: I've lost weight because I can't go out to buy more chocolate
[01:08:12] JIeBuc: I probably need to lose 20 pounds too
[01:08:18] zico: funny you said that because I actually gained more weight because I couldn't go hiking and do outdoor activities
[01:08:50] VIXX: (dark chocolate actually helps lose weight haha)
[01:08:51] radishimo: eating healthier and less
[01:09:04] Eliza: milk chocolat.... Cadburys
[01:09:13] Epsilion: i'm addcited to dark chocolate almonds lately
[01:09:57] JIeBuc: Well, it's not hard to lose weight, just takes time and a little bit of efforts
[01:10:08] Eliza: simple
[01:10:19] beerslayer: simple vs hard
[01:10:28] beerslayer: *simple vs easy
[01:10:31] Now: six-pack
[01:10:40] cronin: what happened to my chat screen %(
[01:10:55] Now: I think with a couple of beers my moves are gonna be bolder
[01:11:15] radishimo: i used to black out on ativan and blitz
[01:11:19] cronin: JB, the MD has spoken
[01:11:30] radishimo: i think my record was 31 games in a day?
[01:11:50] radishimo: don't do benzos, kids
[01:11:54] cronin: how many losses? XD
[01:12:00] Now: lol
[01:12:17] radishimo: i dunno i started at 30k and got to 1d here a few years later
[01:12:26] radishimo: so i won enough
[01:12:29] cronin: reminds me when Bart Simpson tries to be smart and takes up chess and he does a simul
[01:12:40] cronin: cut scene, after the games end and he lost all of them!
[01:13:14] cronin: ah, bragging - the telltale sign of an insecure personality
[01:13:47] radishimo: hey guys, everyone pay attention to the guy trying to pick a fight
[01:13:54] radishimo: what would you like to talk about, cronin
[01:14:21] afgani: only corona talk
[01:14:38] Now: here on Spain the government just said till 9 of may
[01:14:49] Now: so a lot of Go to play
[01:15:00] radishimo: it's too early
[01:15:09] radishimo: there will be a resurgence
[01:15:11] Now: more go even then
[01:15:17] radishimo: can't do anything to stop it, this is so sad
[01:16:26] Now: this is all the age of aquarius, energy has changed, new circle
[01:18:41] radishimo: why is saying what rank you are or were automatically bragging anyway
[01:18:47] VIXX: 9 of may will still be early stage yeah.. no doubt politicians will come forward touting a flattening curve, but indeed a resurgence will lurk for times to come
[01:19:02] radishimo: if anything it's a commentary on how i'm weaker now than i was then
[01:19:38] Now: it doesn´t matter, just play
[01:19:48] VIXX: i honestly don't see how that constitutes bragging either
[01:19:50] VIXX: haha
[01:20:13] radishimo: yeah like
[01:20:19] afgani: cronin  is jealous
[01:20:31] radishimo: "look at this 2k player bragging that he got to 1d, haha he thinks he's so good"
[01:20:38] radishimo: let's take a step back and look at that statement
[01:20:45] Now: I didn´t even think about that
[01:21:05] Now: in fact, I liked your statement of getting to 1d blacking out
[01:21:17] radishimo: like if i wasn't humble about that crap wouldn't i like.. not want to tell people i used to be ranked higher?
[01:21:27] radishimo: because the lower rank would be embarassing?
[01:21:32] radishimo: am i off base thinking that?
[01:21:54] radishimo: i wasn't in a good place and go still made me happy, that's kinda the point of what i was saying
[01:25:32] cronin: i think this conversation is getting really low class, and afgani, shut up, as you can't speak for me
[01:25:49] cronin: but i'm glad if you two found in each other a friend
[01:25:57] LGSam: I think
[01:26:14] LGSam: I think we should appreciate the fact that we are still here
[01:26:26] radishimo: look at the guy who wanted attention trying to highroad us now
[01:26:44] VIXX: hahaha, yeah, that wasn't pompous at all
[01:26:53] VIXX: none noticed lol
[01:27:06] radishimo: yes your internet philosophy is such an example on how we should cast aside mortal  considerations and think about bigger things
[01:27:38] radishimo: nevermind you started the whole thing with "hurrdurr did you lose a lot"
[01:29:41] Now: easily triggered
[01:30:04] Padre: again on the client for IOS thread I started earlier in this room - a KGS user pointed me to this: shin.gokgs.com.  I loaded it on an ipad in safari, was able to login and tried some game play. Worked really well!
[01:30:16] Padre: Does anyone else use that client?
[01:30:41] Muttley: I don't know how to
[01:30:44] Eliza: I tried it.... but it was so slow on my elderly ipad
[01:31:00] Muttley: It said I had to put an extension on chrome or something
[01:31:02] Padre: sounds like you need a relatively new/fast ipad...
[01:31:17] Muttley: so I did, but I didn't know what to do next :))
[01:31:20] Eliza: no... I don't need one.... this works
[01:31:25] Padre: I just loaded that URL in safari. Logged in and got going
[01:31:41] SimeonG: I'm using it right now, no extension needed
[01:31:53] Muttley: Well, Fredda vs Werfeus
[01:31:56] Muttley: watch that instead :)
[01:32:02] Padre: so no need for a native OSX client after all?... :-)
[01:32:48] Padre: I found one thing I didn't like - which is how you can hover over a point and see where the stone will actually drop when you click. Not working in the shin client
[01:33:03] Padre: you touch and hope your grubby finger tip is lined up on the right point :-)
[01:33:39] Padre: touch once and touch again to confirm as an option? 
[01:33:51] Padre: I guess I should ping the developer...
[01:34:39] nonosse: i use that too, just miss a few functionality but works well
[01:34:58] Padre: there's an email feedback link in the client to jkkramer@... anyone here know this person?  I would like to thank them :-)
[01:35:26] afgani: is  it true  that sushi is  really cheap in japan?
[01:35:35] nonosse: you can check on L19 forum
[01:36:11] Eliza: kaiten zushi is cheap
[01:36:42] afgani: whats that?
[01:36:49] radishimo: the conveyor belt
[01:36:56] radishimo: where they charge you per plate
[01:37:03] afgani: how much?
[01:37:05] radishimo: kaiten means rotate
[01:37:28] radishimo: it depends on the quality of place but it can be pretty stupid cheap as far as sushi goes
[01:39:41] frijoles: Any 1800 chess players here?
[01:40:56] afgani: no  c word in  the EGR
[01:42:31] VIXX: *raises hand*
[01:43:04] Eliza: don't worry.... we won't hold it against you
[01:44:24] Marathon: chess? is that the game with the horsies?
[01:44:56] Marathon: i'm not an actor -- but i played one on T.V.
[01:48:57] Muttley: There probably are, frijoles
[01:49:06] Muttley: we should start a chess room for chess players who play go
[01:51:31] whatisgo: chess + go = shogi
[01:51:55] Muttley: um,. no
[01:52:40] Nyanjilla: In Japan, pro go players are often strong shogi players, and pro shogi players are often strong go players
[01:53:44] Muttley: Hana got to IM strength and beat some weaker GMs, but I don't know if he still plays chess
[01:54:57] Muttley: Haba sorry
[02:13:55] cekalo: whats up you quarantined nerds
[02:14:24] Ikinasai: ground hog day
[02:14:37] Ikinasai: every day is the same

[03:34:41] bert: first he discovered he had twin brother in danny devito
[03:35:03] bert: then he became pregnant

[03:43:21] Soromon: It's not a tumor.
[03:44:01] Soromon: Seriously though, Total Recall was the best.
[03:44:20] alfalfa: i don't recall
[03:44:31] Soromon: Blue skies over Mars
[03:45:07] alfalfa: i do recall, i was just joking
[03:45:36] Soromon: I know - Blue Skies Over Mars is the name of the virtual vacation he goes on
[03:45:37] PunGent: But were you totally joking?
[03:46:33] alfalfa: like, totally, dude
[03:46:57] PunGent: You heard about the forest amphibians, man?
[03:47:11] Soromon: Poisonous Tree Frogs?
[03:47:19] PunGent: Toadally, man.
[03:47:37] Soromon: Everything is edible at least once.
[03:48:04] PunGent: At least one thing is Oedipal every time.
[03:48:20] Soromon: That might make you croak, though.
[03:48:31] PunGent: Blind, maybe.
[03:48:33] Werfeus: eat me mr. soromon
[03:48:40] Soromon: Nom nom nom nom
[03:48:47] Werfeus: splendid
[03:49:01] Soromon: <burps> needs salk
[03:49:03] Soromon: *salt
[03:49:33] PunGent: Whereas polio did, in fact, need Salk.
[03:50:47] Soromon: I'd say polio was pretty upset about it.
[03:51:06] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLUG7vW0Es
[03:51:39] Soromon: Speaking of movies tho, I just finished a project for all the quarantinees with some extra time to watch good films. https://imgur.com/gallery/11IbB2X
[03:52:19] Werfeus: fair effort
[03:52:47] Soromon: very soothing werfeus, thx
[03:54:31] Werfeus: you follow it
[03:55:58] Soromon: yeah, listening now - i see Audrey Tautou in your profile, I like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films a lot.
[03:56:36] Werfeus: because love prevails everything
[03:56:46] Now: what´s love for you?
[03:56:53] Werfeus: more than most knwo
[03:56:56] Werfeus: know
[03:57:13] Soromon: What is this? Apparently Led Zeppelin mixed with Pink Floyd? I like it.
[03:57:28] alfalfa: what's love got to do (got to do) with it?
[03:57:57] Soromon: groovy
[03:58:29] Werfeus: it's not that simple alfalfa
[03:58:39] alfalfa: Stairway to Gilligan's Island - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTCYLbFxTpI
[03:58:42] PunGent: Pink Zeppelin.
[03:58:43] Werfeus: love prevails and that's what you want to do
[03:59:10] Werfeus: 'which one's you is pink?'
[03:59:29] PunGent: ... what drunk spectators saw at the docking of the Hindenburg.
[04:00:35] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyOg0mt2R2k
[04:01:02] PunGent: ... probably the most horrible piece of newsreel footage ever shot.
[04:01:28] Werfeus: k
[04:02:37] Epsilion: i cooked some meatballs in tomato sauce from scratch the other day
[04:02:41] PunGent: See for yourself.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWeO1q0gHJE
[04:02:48] Epsilion: werf you'd be proud of me
[04:03:34] Soromon: I did something similar - made marinara from scratch for the first time
[04:03:45] Soromon: cooking is wonderful
[04:03:51] Epsilion: nice
[04:03:57] Epsilion: and rewarding
[04:04:35] Soromon: today i made dry-rub chicken wings... i might never go out again now that I know how to make food as good as a restaurant. as long as one doesn't mind cleaning up.
[04:05:32] alfalfa: "marinara" means "sailor-style"
[04:05:49] Werfeus: pepsi you wanker
[04:06:02] alfalfa: in the style of the mariners
[04:09:09] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqZ8428GSrI&
[04:11:46] Soromon: I'm going down a Kingston Wall hole
[04:12:23] YangTze: black hole
[04:15:28] dustdevil: Kingdston
[04:20:24] AmyTS: warble
[04:23:43] Marathon: i went to the grocery store. they are out of sneeze nuts
[04:26:56] AmyTS: oh no
[04:28:07] Soromon: Sneeze nuts?
[04:29:17] alfalfa: cASHEWs
[04:29:53] mongo: :()
[04:31:45] Soromon: Ugh
[04:32:47] alfalfa: pignolio
[04:33:37] Marathon: geshundheit, alf
[04:34:15] Marathon: they had 4 packs of TP, but not a lot. they were also low on soup and pasta
[04:34:46] alfalfa: i bought beer, but that was it, in and out, got home, washed my hands
[04:35:23] Marathon: and i was kidding about the sneeze nuts -- they have those
[04:35:35] alfalfa: i found that i was overly-criticical of my fellow shoppers
[04:35:55] alfalfa: not audibly, nor visibly
[04:35:58] alfalfa: just in my mind
[04:36:48] alfalfa: there were "one-way" signs on the floor.  somebody went to a certain amount of trouble, to put them there
[04:37:17] alfalfa: not only was there a big arrow, but if you could read it said, "one way" and "single file"
[04:37:30] alfalfa: you know, going down the aisles
[04:37:35] alfalfa: and yet...
[04:37:43] alfalfa: almost defiantly...
[04:38:05] alfalfa: people were walking against the posted signs
[04:38:16] alfalfa: so that you had to run into them
[04:38:34] alfalfa: it was like, "what part of co-operating don't you get?"
[04:38:38] momiji: an existential exercise. we eternally try to enforce our own "identity" against the whole which is consciousness
[04:39:30] alfalfa: so i just figured they couldn't read.  why they don't don't know what an arrow means is still a mystery
[04:39:50] alfalfa: but they do the same thing in the parking lot.
[04:39:58] Marathon: an arrow? in grocery stores?  it means they lowered prices!
[04:40:27] momiji: in the grocery store i've actually had people flee from me
[04:40:57] alfalfa: were you going the wrong way down a one-way aisle?
[04:41:57] momiji: no maybe i appeared to be in the vulnerable demographic, while actally being healthy as a horse
[04:42:10] alfalfa: oh, someone has built a fire,it smells wonderful
[04:43:01] alfalfa: the state dept. of natural resources has placede a ban on burning, but i don't think that it includes fireplaces
[04:43:18] alfalfa: more like leaves and stufff
[04:43:26] momiji: what about hobby arson?
[04:43:30] alfalfa: heh
[04:43:35] alfalfa: already a ban on that
[04:44:17] alfalfa: sometimes i can identify the type of wood by the smell
[04:44:57] alfalfa: cedar is the easiest to identify by aroma
[04:45:54] alfalfa: then various conifers, such as pine, fir, spruce... each has a slightly different smell
[04:46:02] momiji: norwegian wood is good
[04:46:08] alfalfa: heh
[04:47:07] alfalfa: deciduous trees too, have specific aromas... hickory, apple
[04:47:16] alfalfa: cherry tree
[04:47:27] alfalfa: it does not smell like cherries though
[04:48:16] momiji: bonsai, for a mini fire
[04:48:24] alfalfa: many people like mesquite for smoking meat
[04:48:49] alfalfa: it has a distinctive sweet aroma and taste
[04:49:20] alfalfa: but hickory, apple, cherry, these are good for smoking bacon
[04:49:55] alfalfa: they don't seem to use conifers to smoke meats
[04:50:08] Soromon: cherry burns hot but doesn't smoke much
[04:50:29] alfalfa: i guess hardwoods are superior to soft
[04:50:45] alfalfa: i dunno
[04:51:26] Werfeus: my wood is superior to most
[04:54:14] zico: There were some trees that smelt so bad at my alma mater. Their smells reminded you of men's bodily fluid
[04:54:40] crazyeight: you act as if that's something that smells terrible
[04:55:23] zico: does it smell pleasant to you?
[04:56:27] crazyeight: normally when you talk about bad smells, garbage and rotten eggs come to mind
[04:56:30] alfalfa: you don't mean when they were burning.  you mean just when they were growing
[04:56:49] alfalfa: where was that college
[04:57:14] alfalfa: i think i know the sort of trees you mean
[04:57:27] zico: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qk97b3/trees-smell-like-vomit-jizz-barf-semen-spring
[04:57:37] crazyeight: I can think of at least half a dozen things that smell absolutely terrible that would've made for a better comparison
[04:57:53] crazyeight: vomit is one of them
[04:57:56] Soromon: some people don't like the smell of Ginko
[04:57:59] Soromon: but the leaves are gorgeous
[04:58:23] zico: yea, gingko tree smells like vomit
[04:58:23] crazyeight: skunks
[04:58:26] crazyeight: road kill
[04:58:46] alfalfa: but where did you attend college?
[04:58:56] zico: i went to a college in midwest
[04:59:01] Soromon: same
[05:01:36] alfalfa: ok, i am not trying to stalk you , i went to northnwestern u. near chicago, then i went to u. of illinois at urbana-champaign
[05:01:47] alfalfa: so that's how i know what you mean
[05:03:00] alfalfa: i have worked for the u. o wisconsin for the last twenty-five years.   but they don't seem to have those bushes here.
[05:03:01] zico: god. that's scary
[05:03:44] alfalfa: maybe we were in classes together
[05:04:36] zico: hahaha
[05:05:21] zico: I went there in early 2010s. you're right, i attended one of those colleges you mentioned
[05:05:36] alfalfa: ah, after i was there
[05:06:04] alfalfa: i moved to wisconsin in 1994
[05:08:56] IamCat: hello everyone i just joined yea
[05:09:06] zico: I visited Madison once. They had a road filled with ginkgo trees at the University. It was near the Chazen Museum. But, they didn't smell like vomit, though
[05:10:55] clydesdale: apparently american porcupines smell of BO
[05:11:22] clydesdale: like old socks
[05:11:28] zico: whose BO? I notice different ethnicity has different BO
[05:12:14] alfalfa: that's diet.
[05:13:15] IamCat: is kgs still going strong ?
[05:13:22] clydesdale: most common cause of death of american porcupines is falling out oftrees
[05:13:31] zico: maybe. But, if I have my eyes closed and smell people's BO, i will know whether they are korean, chinese, japanese, white, or black
[05:13:43] alfalfa: you eat comfort food.  comfort food is what you were raised on. that's what you smell like
[05:14:25] alfalfa: sure, there's a difference, i am only explaining the mechanism
[05:14:35] clydesdale: are you some kind of connoiseur, zico?
[05:14:46] zico: and i'm explaining my hidden talent. hehe
[05:14:52] alfalfa: no he has just made observations
[05:15:12] zico: well, in this case, I'm a BO connoiseur. JK
[05:15:19] alfalfa: japanese say westerners "smell like butter"
[05:15:47] Now: How can I become 8d, zico?
[05:16:23] zico: i'm no 8d. not even close.
[05:17:10] clydesdale: what kind of dog is that in your user info, zico?
[05:17:17] clydesdale: borzoi?
[05:17:54] zico: I haven't heard the borzoi breed. so, I goodled. God. not even close
[05:17:58] zico: it's chow chow
[05:18:51] clydesdale: ah
[05:19:51] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:20:26] alfalfa: Piccalilly Circus
[05:20:50] Epsilion: isn't it piccadilly?
[05:21:09] alfalfa: yes of course
[05:21:16] alfalfa: but
[05:21:48] alfalfa: besides being a breed of dog, "chow-chow" is also the name of a sauce, and that sauce is sometime called....
[05:21:56] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:22:06] alfalfa: which happens to sound like what you said
[05:22:52] Epsilion: i've heard of chow-chow, but didn't know the other name
[05:23:03] Epsilion: green tomatoes?
[05:23:10] zico: I don't even know a sauce named chow chow
[05:23:22] zico: from now on, piccalilly will be my alias
[05:24:01] alfalfa: well, there is another wrinkle... in fact, "green tomatoes" are not tomatoes at all
[05:24:17] alfalfa: not even the ones in "fried green tomatoes"
[05:24:35] Marathon: on of dsaun's rhymes was about troll chow
[05:24:47] alfalfa: they are a different plant, "tomatillo"
[05:25:02] clydesdale: Chows are powerful, compactly built dogs standing as high as 20 inches at the shoulder. Their distinctive traits include a lion’s-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.  Owners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified. They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life.
[05:25:25] Epsilion: ah neat
[05:25:50] Epsilion: what do you serve it with?
[05:25:53] alfalfa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatillo
[05:26:20] Epsilion: here we've served it with fishcakes, which i've always thought was an odd combo
[05:26:43] alfalfa: hmmm something pickled, not too odd
[05:27:13] Epsilion: chow-chow with pickles?
[05:27:30] YangTze: chow mein
[05:29:28] Epsilion: we have pickled herring here
[05:29:37] Epsilion: it's an acquired taste
[05:30:02] Marathon: my dad and i really liked herring in wine sauce
[05:31:06] clydesdale: sounds tasty marathon
[05:32:36] Marathon: it is
[05:34:20] KillerMonk: how do i finish a game if the opponent does not want to accept the result?
[05:35:07] Marathon: if it is a ranked game, contact an admin via private chat.
[05:35:20] KillerMonk: yes ok thanks
[05:35:31] KillerMonk: how do i do that?
[05:35:34] Marathon: edlee, and lelliot are admins, and logged in now.
[05:35:34] KillerMonk: :)
[05:35:46] Marathon: find their names in the list >>>>>>>>>
[05:35:49] Marathon: and click on the name
[05:36:06] Marathon: for future reference, and admin will have 5 point star next to name
[05:36:22] Marathon: yw
[05:39:41] KillerMonk: thanks Marathon
[05:39:55] KillerMonk: just got this resolved . thanks for your help
[05:48:19] DeaconJohn: Hi Amy.  Good to see you.  I've been gone quite a while.
[05:49:10] DeaconJohn: Do you remember when somebody recommended that you get in a friendly group, and, they recommended KGS!
[05:49:35] DeaconJohn: That was quite an honor for us KGSers.
[05:50:32] DeaconJohn: I have not been around for a while, so I'm double glad that you are still here.
[05:51:01] Marathon: yw, monk
[05:51:28] AmyTS: hi
[05:51:50] slb: hi
[05:51:55] DeaconJohn: I'm waiting for a game, so I might disappear unexpectedly.
[05:51:59] slb: https://senseis.xmp.net/?TheRhymesOfDsaun
[05:55:07] Epsilion: i hope someone saved more of them
[05:56:35] slb: yea
[05:57:10] Natalino: hello
[06:05:19] Marathon: so do i.
[06:05:38] Marathon: there was one about troll chow and another about woolymacha
[06:06:29] Marathon: i didn't see the one about apple pie until i saw the tribute page
[06:13:33] AmyTS: i haven't seen wooly in a while
[06:16:41] Marathon: He seems to be rarely on. It's been that way for several years now.
[06:17:12] Marathon: His info says he was here yesterday
[06:18:13] Marathon: dsaun's rhyme has a line about wooly tromping through snow, and ends with something like "ten thousand years of ko"
[06:51:45] GULFOSS: tahoe49 escaper
[06:52:42] Marathon: no public denunciations!   When players leave a game early: http://www.gokgs.com/help/faq/escapers.html

[07:22:10] Goeland: Ramen
[07:45:47] lithograph: does anyone know if EGR chat is archived?
[07:47:00] Eatwisdom: for everyone's sake i hope not
[07:50:43] Marathon: archived how far back?
[07:52:18] lithograph: since its birth ?
[07:52:53] Marathon: no, it's not archived that far back.
[07:53:14] Marathon: a few days, a week or so
[07:53:35] Marathon: why? do you want to recover some of dsaun's rhymes or other sayings?
[07:54:15] lithograph: I really wasn't familar with his poetry.
[07:54:27] lithograph: but that's what prompted my question
[07:54:45] Marathon: too bad we didn't think to save copies ourselves,
[07:55:25] lithograph: i was hoping to purchase a bound copy of the whole chat log, but i guess not possible
[07:58:22] Marathon: your best bet is to look in the games archives
[07:59:03] Marathon: but that's a lot of work.  especially if you are looking for what dsaun said in kibitz
[08:00:27] lithograph: I was imagining an archive of the whole kibitz as being a cool niche historical document
[08:01:16] Marathon: maybe the AGF can make it available.  i
[08:01:24] Marathon: i wonder how much space it takes up?
[08:02:26] lithograph: you think it exists somewhere behind an admin key?
[08:02:47] Marathon: it exists in a KGS server or servers
[08:03:53] lithograph: like all the way back? that's great.
[08:04:41] Marathon: wms used to be able to create a file or something that had all game headers from the archive -- date, time, white player, white rank, black player, black rank, handicap, komi, result -- no moves or chat
[08:05:01] Marathon: he would create it upon request when someone wanted to do some research
[08:07:03] lithograph: i thought game records and .sgfs were accessible, because that kgs analytics site can get them.
[08:07:27] Marathon: they are
[08:09:47] Marathon: almost every game of more than 10 moves played on KGS is there.
[08:10:35] Marathon: there are a few gaps. i assume the gaps are the result of crashes causing corrpution in the archives database.
[08:10:55] lithograph: How would you feel about a site that displayed every day of EGR kibitz? 
[08:11:17] lithograph: Would you think that as somehow intrusive?
[08:14:24] Marathon: i don't know that it would be useful. it would consume resources without good reason
[08:16:44] Marathon: maybe you could write to the AGF, and ask for a copy of the games archive
[08:17:02] Marathon: and then you can mine it for dsaun's chat
[08:17:51] Marathon: he had trouble with his hands late in life, and didn't like to type. so, for his teaching games, he used the microphone.  audio is not recorded in the archives.
[08:19:53] lithograph: i see that he was well liked. 
[08:21:05] lithograph: Thanks for answering my questions, Marathon.  gonna reinitiate 'lurk mode'.
[08:21:05] Marathon: he was indeed.
[08:21:34] Marathon: hmmm -- for some reason, when i try to access his oldest games from the archives, i get a "Forbidden" error
[08:49:15] radishimo: i can't imagine it being intrusive
[08:49:23] radishimo: chat logs are a thing for all sorts of reasons
[08:49:37] radishimo: i'd love to see the time i started an argument by asking maladroit why gravity happens
[08:49:41] radishimo: 5 people were banned
[08:51:06] marzo: oh the good old days
[08:51:46] radishimo: back when chemboy was still around
[08:52:11] radishimo: dsaun and i argued a lot but i liked to think of him as a friend anyway
[08:52:27] radishimo: i am very sad, he was a great guy
[08:52:51] marzo: he was a great guy

[20:06:07] scientia: Hi guys, any c programmer with experience on tcp/ip?
[20:19:43] UTDEspy: Are you talking "Writing a program that does networking" or are you actually talking at the networking layer / driver / embedded level?
[20:25:19] Marathon: the 2020 united states go congress has been canceled.
[20:25:30] Marathon: why did it take so long for them to decide that?
[20:25:46] UTDEspy: The right, sad, decision. A lot of people have been putting things off in the hopes that maybe something, some how would fix things.
[20:26:10] UTDEspy: Some venue holders have cancelation policies that make it extremely expensive so people were waiting until it was literally illegal to have the con, which changes how insurance and stuff manage things
[20:26:44] scientia: writing a program that does networking, just wondering about good resources to learn
[20:27:21] UTDEspy: Oooh, good news Scientia - You probably won't need to actually get into any of the ACTUAL communication. For C you're probably going to want to look up "Sockets"
[20:27:42] UTDEspy: By ACTUAL communication I mean error handling, handshakes, the tcp/ip stuff
[20:27:59] UTDEspy: You'll tend to just get a bitstream that's already been put through that process, so there's More reliability
[20:28:30] scientia: the actual communication seems more interesting now that you said it
[20:29:11] UTDEspy: Hahaha, it's great, and interesting, and I hope you never have to do it
[20:29:21] scientia: but yes I have been reading about sockets
[20:29:38] UTDEspy: As fun it can be a lot of fun to poke around, but actually mucking about at lower levels can be a pain with no gain
[20:29:50] alfalfa: this is the best C code i have ever seen for keeping track of multiple sockets/network connections:
[20:29:53] alfalfa: https://userver.uwaterloo.ca/
[20:30:15] alfalfa: you can learn a lot just by reading that code
[20:30:37] scientia: great! thanks man
[20:30:41] alfalfa: yw
[20:30:58] Equinox: f.a.b.
[20:31:48] scientia: UTDEspy but learning is valuable
[20:32:21] scientia: maybe you have some great read on the lower level stuff?
[20:32:45] UTDEspy: All my lowerlevel stuff was based on the CCNA curriculum ages ago, before, ironically, it was super easy to find good resources online
[20:33:04] UTDEspy: Ran through CCNA and CCNP stuff and paid a ton of attention and it's just rattled around in my head since
[20:34:00] Zahlman: hi espy, good to see you again
[20:34:10] UTDEspy: I'd suggest looking up the OSI 7 Layer Model and TCP/IP handshakes
[20:34:52] UTDEspy: Just about any site talking about that should give you some idea. It helps to think about what levels you're actually touching for framing of the problem space, but also to NOT get too bogged down in what other layers are doing
[20:34:57] alfalfa: mmm, seven-layer dip
[20:35:11] UTDEspy: Hey Zahlman! Yeah, good to be back, it's been too long
[20:35:24] UTDEspy: I'm tryin to do the teaching game thing again
[20:35:31] scientia: nice thanks man

[22:43:33] arndt: "No public accusations! Talk to an admin in private if you witness a problem on KGS."
[22:44:07] knockknock: please adim to check message from him and game
[22:44:16] knockknock: it's not first time
[22:45:11] knockknock: so sad for 3D level
[22:48:47] knockknock: how to contact admin? no replay
[22:51:57] papaya: i never understood why we couldn't publicly accuse selfish players
[22:52:00] reduced50: Most of the probems I witness on KGS are my own bad moves
[22:52:07] papaya: shouldn't others beware of these people?
[22:52:23] bolbi: feel free to read the FAQ, papaya
[22:54:26] papaya: seems like a decent system
[22:54:37] kindred: public accusations get old very quickly
[22:54:40] papaya: i mean, escapers are eventually punished after 6 months
[22:54:58] bolbi: before 6 months
[22:55:25] kindred: 10 or so games escaped, before they start to forfeit the games
[22:55:44] bolbi: sometimes, they lose as soon as they escape
[22:55:53] kindred: yes
[22:55:57] Now: jeez 8 victories in a row and still my rank doesn´t go up
[22:56:26] papaya: probably just need one more!

[22:56:33] regularfit: years ago i had 41 vitories in a row without promoting
[22:56:36] regularfit: no joke
[22:57:41] Now: that´s bad
[22:58:18] regularfit: thats due to the broad time window of weighted average they have here
[23:03:53] JY0034: who are the admins?
[23:04:36] kindred: they're the ones with five pointed star next to their name

[00:17:59] Eliza: there is an HTML version, but....
[00:18:10] Padre: Ok thanks. That's a headscratcher. Must be something technical?...
[00:18:26] alfalfa: no, social.
[00:18:47] alfalfa: Apple refuses to support Java, just out of spite and malice.
[00:19:09] alfalfa: so that's the reason we can't have nice things
[00:19:17] Eliza: mind you.... Java does suck
[00:19:24] alfalfa: no it doesn't

[01:01:18] radishimo: i've spoken with people that have had acquintances die from it but it's always been second hand

[01:07:36] radishimo: 25 more to go...
[01:07:51] Eliza: I've lost weight because I can't go out to buy more chocolate
[01:08:12] JIeBuc: I probably need to lose 20 pounds too
[01:08:18] zico: funny you said that because I actually gained more weight because I couldn't go hiking and do outdoor activities
[01:08:50] VIXX: (dark chocolate actually helps lose weight haha)
[01:08:51] radishimo: eating healthier and less
[01:09:04] Eliza: milk chocolat.... Cadburys
[01:09:13] Epsilion: i'm addcited to dark chocolate almonds lately
[01:09:57] JIeBuc: Well, it's not hard to lose weight, just takes time and a little bit of efforts

[01:11:30] radishimo: i think my record was 31 games in a day?
[01:11:50] radishimo: don't do benzos, kids
[01:11:54] cronin: how many losses? XD
[01:12:00] Now: lol
[01:12:17] radishimo: i dunno i started at 30k and got to 1d here a few years later
[01:12:26] radishimo: so i won enough
[01:12:29] cronin: reminds me when Bart Simpson tries to be smart and takes up chess and he does a simul
[01:12:40] cronin: cut scene, after the games end and he lost all of them!
[01:13:14] cronin: ah, bragging - the telltale sign of an insecure personality
[01:13:47] radishimo: hey guys, everyone pay attention to the guy trying to pick a fight
[01:13:54] radishimo: what would you like to talk about, cronin
[01:14:21] afgani: only corona talk
[01:14:38] Now: here on Spain the government just said till 9 of may
[01:14:49] Now: so a lot of Go to play
[01:15:00] radishimo: it's too early
[01:15:09] radishimo: there will be a resurgence
[01:15:11] Now: more go even then
[01:15:17] radishimo: can't do anything to stop it, this is so sad
[01:16:26] Now: this is all the age of aquarius, energy has changed, new circle
[01:18:41] radishimo: why is saying what rank you are or were automatically bragging anyway
[01:18:47] VIXX: 9 of may will still be early stage yeah.. no doubt politicians will come forward touting a flattening curve, but indeed a resurgence will lurk for times to come
[01:19:02] radishimo: if anything it's a commentary on how i'm weaker now than i was then
[01:19:38] Now: it doesn´t matter, just play
[01:19:48] VIXX: i honestly don't see how that constitutes bragging either
[01:19:50] VIXX: haha
[01:20:13] radishimo: yeah like
[01:20:19] afgani: cronin  is jealous
[01:20:31] radishimo: "look at this 2k player bragging that he got to 1d, haha he thinks he's so good"
[01:20:38] radishimo: let's take a step back and look at that statement
[01:20:45] Now: I didn´t even think about that
[01:21:05] Now: in fact, I liked your statement of getting to 1d blacking out
[01:21:17] radishimo: like if i wasn't humble about that crap wouldn't i like.. not want to tell people i used to be ranked higher?
[01:21:27] radishimo: because the lower rank would be embarassing?
[01:21:32] radishimo: am i off base thinking that?
[01:21:54] radishimo: i wasn't in a good place and go still made me happy, that's kinda the point of what i was saying
[01:25:32] cronin: i think this conversation is getting really low class, and afgani, shut up, as you can't speak for me
[01:25:49] cronin: but i'm glad if you two found in each other a friend
[01:25:57] LGSam: I think
[01:26:14] LGSam: I think we should appreciate the fact that we are still here
[01:26:26] radishimo: look at the guy who wanted attention trying to highroad us now
[01:26:44] VIXX: hahaha, yeah, that wasn't pompous at all
[01:26:53] VIXX: none noticed lol
[01:27:06] radishimo: yes your internet philosophy is such an example on how we should cast aside mortal  considerations and think about bigger things
[01:27:38] radishimo: nevermind you started the whole thing with "hurrdurr did you lose a lot"
[01:29:41] Now: easily triggered
[01:30:04] Padre: again on the client for IOS thread I started earlier in this room - a KGS user pointed me to this: shin.gokgs.com.  I loaded it on an ipad in safari, was able to login and tried some game play. Worked really well!
[01:30:16] Padre: Does anyone else use that client?
[01:30:41] Muttley: I don't know how to
[01:30:44] Eliza: I tried it.... but it was so slow on my elderly ipad
[01:31:00] Muttley: It said I had to put an extension on chrome or something
[01:31:02] Padre: sounds like you need a relatively new/fast ipad...
[01:31:17] Muttley: so I did, but I didn't know what to do next :))
[01:31:20] Eliza: no... I don't need one.... this works
[01:31:25] Padre: I just loaded that URL in safari. Logged in and got going
[01:31:41] SimeonG: I'm using it right now, no extension needed
[01:31:53] Muttley: Well, Fredda vs Werfeus
[01:31:56] Muttley: watch that instead :)
[01:32:02] Padre: so no need for a native OSX client after all?... :-)
[01:32:48] Padre: I found one thing I didn't like - which is how you can hover over a point and see where the stone will actually drop when you click. Not working in the shin client
[01:33:03] Padre: you touch and hope your grubby finger tip is lined up on the right point :-)
[01:33:39] Padre: touch once and touch again to confirm as an option? 
[01:33:51] Padre: I guess I should ping the developer...
[01:34:39] nonosse: i use that too, just miss a few functionality but works well
[01:34:58] Padre: there's an email feedback link in the client to jkkramer@... anyone here know this person?  I would like to thank them :-)
[01:35:26] afgani: is  it true  that sushi is  really cheap in japan?
[01:35:35] nonosse: you can check on L19 forum
[01:36:11] Eliza: kaiten zushi is cheap
[01:36:42] afgani: whats that?
[01:36:49] radishimo: the conveyor belt
[01:36:56] radishimo: where they charge you per plate
[01:37:03] afgani: how much?
[01:37:05] radishimo: kaiten means rotate
[01:37:28] radishimo: it depends on the quality of place but it can be pretty stupid cheap as far as sushi goes
[01:39:41] frijoles: Any 1800 chess players here?
[01:40:56] afgani: no  c word in  the EGR
[01:42:31] VIXX: *raises hand*
[01:43:04] Eliza: don't worry.... we won't hold it against you
[01:44:24] Marathon: chess? is that the game with the horsies?
[01:44:56] Marathon: i'm not an actor -- but i played one on T.V.
[01:48:57] Muttley: There probably are, frijoles
[01:49:06] Muttley: we should start a chess room for chess players who play go
[01:51:31] whatisgo: chess + go = shogi
[01:51:55] Muttley: um,. no
[01:52:40] Nyanjilla: In Japan, pro go players are often strong shogi players, and pro shogi players are often strong go players
[01:53:44] Muttley: Hana got to IM strength and beat some weaker GMs, but I don't know if he still plays chess
[01:54:57] Muttley: Haba sorry

[03:47:37] Soromon: Everything is edible at least once.
[03:48:04] PunGent: At least one thing is Oedipal every time.
[03:48:20] Soromon: That might make you croak, though.
[03:48:31] PunGent: Blind, maybe.
[03:48:33] Werfeus: eat me mr. soromon
[03:48:40] Soromon: Nom nom nom nom
[03:48:47] Werfeus: splendid
[03:49:01] Soromon: <burps> needs salk
[03:49:03] Soromon: *salt
[03:49:33] PunGent: Whereas polio did, in fact, need Salk.
[03:50:47] Soromon: I'd say polio was pretty upset about it.
[03:51:06] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLUG7vW0Es
[03:51:39] Soromon: Speaking of movies tho, I just finished a project for all the quarantinees with some extra time to watch good films. https://imgur.com/gallery/11IbB2X
[03:52:19] Werfeus: fair effort
[03:52:47] Soromon: very soothing werfeus, thx
[03:54:31] Werfeus: you follow it
[03:55:58] Soromon: yeah, listening now - i see Audrey Tautou in your profile, I like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films a lot.
[03:56:36] Werfeus: because love prevails everything
[03:56:46] Now: what´s love for you?
[03:56:53] Werfeus: more than most knwo
[03:56:56] Werfeus: know
[03:57:13] Soromon: What is this? Apparently Led Zeppelin mixed with Pink Floyd? I like it.
[03:57:28] alfalfa: what's love got to do (got to do) with it?
[03:57:57] Soromon: groovy
[03:58:29] Werfeus: it's not that simple alfalfa
[03:58:39] alfalfa: Stairway to Gilligan's Island - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTCYLbFxTpI
[03:58:42] PunGent: Pink Zeppelin.
[03:58:43] Werfeus: love prevails and that's what you want to do
[03:59:10] Werfeus: 'which one's you is pink?'
[03:59:29] PunGent: ... what drunk spectators saw at the docking of the Hindenburg.
[04:00:35] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyOg0mt2R2k
[04:01:02] PunGent: ... probably the most horrible piece of newsreel footage ever shot.
[04:01:28] Werfeus: k
[04:02:37] Epsilion: i cooked some meatballs in tomato sauce from scratch the other day
[04:02:41] PunGent: See for yourself.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWeO1q0gHJE
[04:02:48] Epsilion: werf you'd be proud of me
[04:03:34] Soromon: I did something similar - made marinara from scratch for the first time
[04:03:45] Soromon: cooking is wonderful
[04:03:51] Epsilion: nice
[04:03:57] Epsilion: and rewarding
[04:04:35] Soromon: today i made dry-rub chicken wings... i might never go out again now that I know how to make food as good as a restaurant. as long as one doesn't mind cleaning up.
[04:05:32] alfalfa: "marinara" means "sailor-style"
[04:05:49] Werfeus: pepsi you wanker
[04:06:02] alfalfa: in the style of the mariners
[04:09:09] Werfeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqZ8428GSrI&
[04:11:46] Soromon: I'm going down a Kingston Wall hole
[04:12:23] YangTze: black hole
[04:15:28] dustdevil: Kingdston
[04:20:24] AmyTS: warble
[04:23:43] Marathon: i went to the grocery store. they are out of sneeze nuts
[04:26:56] AmyTS: oh no
[04:28:07] Soromon: Sneeze nuts?
[04:29:17] alfalfa: cASHEWs
[04:29:53] mongo: :()
[04:31:45] Soromon: Ugh
[04:32:47] alfalfa: pignolio
[04:33:37] Marathon: geshundheit, alf
[04:34:15] Marathon: they had 4 packs of TP, but not a lot. they were also low on soup and pasta
[04:34:46] alfalfa: i bought beer, but that was it, in and out, got home, washed my hands
[04:35:23] Marathon: and i was kidding about the sneeze nuts -- they have those
[04:35:35] alfalfa: i found that i was overly-criticical of my fellow shoppers
[04:35:55] alfalfa: not audibly, nor visibly
[04:35:58] alfalfa: just in my mind
[04:36:48] alfalfa: there were "one-way" signs on the floor.  somebody went to a certain amount of trouble, to put them there
[04:37:17] alfalfa: not only was there a big arrow, but if you could read it said, "one way" and "single file"
[04:37:30] alfalfa: you know, going down the aisles
[04:37:35] alfalfa: and yet...
[04:37:43] alfalfa: almost defiantly...
[04:38:05] alfalfa: people were walking against the posted signs
[04:38:16] alfalfa: so that you had to run into them
[04:38:34] alfalfa: it was like, "what part of co-operating don't you get?"
[04:38:38] momiji: an existential exercise. we eternally try to enforce our own "identity" against the whole which is consciousness
[04:39:30] alfalfa: so i just figured they couldn't read.  why they don't don't know what an arrow means is still a mystery
[04:39:50] alfalfa: but they do the same thing in the parking lot.
[04:39:58] Marathon: an arrow? in grocery stores?  it means they lowered prices!
[04:40:27] momiji: in the grocery store i've actually had people flee from me
[04:40:57] alfalfa: were you going the wrong way down a one-way aisle?
[04:41:57] momiji: no maybe i appeared to be in the vulnerable demographic, while actally being healthy as a horse
[04:42:10] alfalfa: oh, someone has built a fire,it smells wonderful
[04:43:01] alfalfa: the state dept. of natural resources has placede a ban on burning, but i don't think that it includes fireplaces
[04:43:18] alfalfa: more like leaves and stufff
[04:43:26] momiji: what about hobby arson?
[04:43:30] alfalfa: heh
[04:43:35] alfalfa: already a ban on that
[04:44:17] alfalfa: sometimes i can identify the type of wood by the smell
[04:44:57] alfalfa: cedar is the easiest to identify by aroma
[04:45:54] alfalfa: then various conifers, such as pine, fir, spruce... each has a slightly different smell
[04:46:02] momiji: norwegian wood is good
[04:46:08] alfalfa: heh
[04:47:07] alfalfa: deciduous trees too, have specific aromas... hickory, apple
[04:47:16] alfalfa: cherry tree
[04:47:27] alfalfa: it does not smell like cherries though
[04:48:16] momiji: bonsai, for a mini fire
[04:48:24] alfalfa: many people like mesquite for smoking meat
[04:48:49] alfalfa: it has a distinctive sweet aroma and taste
[04:49:20] alfalfa: but hickory, apple, cherry, these are good for smoking bacon
[04:49:55] alfalfa: they don't seem to use conifers to smoke meats
[04:50:08] Soromon: cherry burns hot but doesn't smoke much
[04:50:29] alfalfa: i guess hardwoods are superior to soft
[04:50:45] alfalfa: i dunno
[04:51:26] Werfeus: my wood is superior to most
[04:54:14] zico: There were some trees that smelt so bad at my alma mater. Their smells reminded you of men's bodily fluid
[04:54:40] crazyeight: you act as if that's something that smells terrible
[04:55:23] zico: does it smell pleasant to you?
[04:56:27] crazyeight: normally when you talk about bad smells, garbage and rotten eggs come to mind
[04:56:30] alfalfa: you don't mean when they were burning.  you mean just when they were growing
[04:56:49] alfalfa: where was that college
[04:57:14] alfalfa: i think i know the sort of trees you mean
[04:57:27] zico: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qk97b3/trees-smell-like-vomit-jizz-barf-semen-spring
[04:57:37] crazyeight: I can think of at least half a dozen things that smell absolutely terrible that would've made for a better comparison
[04:57:53] crazyeight: vomit is one of them
[04:57:56] Soromon: some people don't like the smell of Ginko
[04:57:59] Soromon: but the leaves are gorgeous
[04:58:23] zico: yea, gingko tree smells like vomit
[04:58:23] crazyeight: skunks
[04:58:26] crazyeight: road kill
[04:58:46] alfalfa: but where did you attend college?
[04:58:56] zico: i went to a college in midwest
[04:59:01] Soromon: same
[05:01:36] alfalfa: ok, i am not trying to stalk you , i went to northnwestern u. near chicago, then i went to u. of illinois at urbana-champaign
[05:01:47] alfalfa: so that's how i know what you mean
[05:03:00] alfalfa: i have worked for the u. o wisconsin for the last twenty-five years.   but they don't seem to have those bushes here.
[05:03:01] zico: god. that's scary
[05:03:44] alfalfa: maybe we were in classes together
[05:04:36] zico: hahaha
[05:05:21] zico: I went there in early 2010s. you're right, i attended one of those colleges you mentioned
[05:05:36] alfalfa: ah, after i was there
[05:06:04] alfalfa: i moved to wisconsin in 1994
[05:08:56] IamCat: hello everyone i just joined yea
[05:09:06] zico: I visited Madison once. They had a road filled with ginkgo trees at the University. It was near the Chazen Museum. But, they didn't smell like vomit, though
[05:10:55] clydesdale: apparently american porcupines smell of BO
[05:11:22] clydesdale: like old socks
[05:11:28] zico: whose BO? I notice different ethnicity has different BO
[05:12:14] alfalfa: that's diet.
[05:13:15] IamCat: is kgs still going strong ?
[05:13:22] clydesdale: most common cause of death of american porcupines is falling out oftrees
[05:13:31] zico: maybe. But, if I have my eyes closed and smell people's BO, i will know whether they are korean, chinese, japanese, white, or black
[05:13:43] alfalfa: you eat comfort food.  comfort food is what you were raised on. that's what you smell like
[05:14:25] alfalfa: sure, there's a difference, i am only explaining the mechanism
[05:14:35] clydesdale: are you some kind of connoiseur, zico?
[05:14:46] zico: and i'm explaining my hidden talent. hehe
[05:14:52] alfalfa: no he has just made observations
[05:15:12] zico: well, in this case, I'm a BO connoiseur. JK
[05:15:19] alfalfa: japanese say westerners "smell like butter"
[05:15:47] Now: How can I become 8d, zico?
[05:16:23] zico: i'm no 8d. not even close.
[05:17:10] clydesdale: what kind of dog is that in your user info, zico?
[05:17:17] clydesdale: borzoi?
[05:17:54] zico: I haven't heard the borzoi breed. so, I goodled. God. not even close
[05:17:58] zico: it's chow chow
[05:18:51] clydesdale: ah
[05:19:51] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:20:26] alfalfa: Piccalilly Circus
[05:20:50] Epsilion: isn't it piccadilly?
[05:21:09] alfalfa: yes of course
[05:21:16] alfalfa: but
[05:21:48] alfalfa: besides being a breed of dog, "chow-chow" is also the name of a sauce, and that sauce is sometime called....
[05:21:56] alfalfa: piccalilly
[05:22:06] alfalfa: which happens to sound like what you said
[05:22:52] Epsilion: i've heard of chow-chow, but didn't know the other name
[05:23:03] Epsilion: green tomatoes?
[05:23:10] zico: I don't even know a sauce named chow chow
[05:23:22] zico: from now on, piccalilly will be my alias
[05:24:01] alfalfa: well, there is another wrinkle... in fact, "green tomatoes" are not tomatoes at all
[05:24:17] alfalfa: not even the ones in "fried green tomatoes"
[05:24:35] Marathon: on of dsaun's rhymes was about troll chow
[05:24:47] alfalfa: they are a different plant, "tomatillo"
[05:25:02] clydesdale: Chows are powerful, compactly built dogs standing as high as 20 inches at the shoulder. Their distinctive traits include a lion’s-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have rough or smooth coats of red, black, blue, cinnamon, or cream.  Owners say Chows are the cleanest of dogs: They housebreak easily, have little doggy odor, and are known to be as fastidious as cats. Well-socialized Chows are never fierce or intractable, but always refined and dignified. They are aloof with strangers and eternally loyal to loved ones. Serene and adaptable, with no special exercise needs, Chows happily take to city life.
[05:25:25] Epsilion: ah neat
[05:25:50] Epsilion: what do you serve it with?
[05:25:53] alfalfa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatillo
[05:26:20] Epsilion: here we've served it with fishcakes, which i've always thought was an odd combo
[05:26:43] alfalfa: hmmm something pickled, not too odd
[05:27:13] Epsilion: chow-chow with pickles?
[05:27:30] YangTze: chow mein
[05:29:28] Epsilion: we have pickled herring here
[05:29:37] Epsilion: it's an acquired taste
[05:30:02] Marathon: my dad and i really liked herring in wine sauce
[05:31:06] clydesdale: sounds tasty marathon
[05:32:36] Marathon: it is
[05:34:20] KillerMonk: how do i finish a game if the opponent does not want to accept the result?
[05:35:07] Marathon: if it is a ranked game, contact an admin via private chat.
[05:35:20] KillerMonk: yes ok thanks
[05:35:31] KillerMonk: how do i do that?
[05:35:34] Marathon: edlee, and lelliot are admins, and logged in now.
[05:35:34] KillerMonk: :)
[05:35:46] Marathon: find their names in the list >>>>>>>>>
[05:35:49] Marathon: and click on the name
[05:36:06] Marathon: for future reference, and admin will have 5 point star next to name
[05:36:22] Marathon: yw
[05:39:41] KillerMonk: thanks Marathon
[05:39:55] KillerMonk: just got this resolved . thanks for your help
[05:48:19] DeaconJohn: Hi Amy.  Good to see you.  I've been gone quite a while.
[05:49:10] DeaconJohn: Do you remember when somebody recommended that you get in a friendly group, and, they recommended KGS!
[05:49:35] DeaconJohn: That was quite an honor for us KGSers.
[05:50:32] DeaconJohn: I have not been around for a while, so I'm double glad that you are still here.
[05:51:01] Marathon: yw, monk
[05:51:28] AmyTS: hi
[05:51:50] slb: hi
[05:51:55] DeaconJohn: I'm waiting for a game, so I might disappear unexpectedly.
[05:51:59] slb: https://senseis.xmp.net/?TheRhymesOfDsaun
[05:55:07] Epsilion: i hope someone saved more of them
[05:56:35] slb: yea
[05:57:10] Natalino: hello
[06:05:19] Marathon: so do i.
[06:05:38] Marathon: there was one about troll chow and another about woolymacha
[06:06:29] Marathon: i didn't see the one about apple pie until i saw the tribute page
[06:13:33] AmyTS: i haven't seen wooly in a while
[06:16:41] Marathon: He seems to be rarely on. It's been that way for several years now.
[06:17:12] Marathon: His info says he was here yesterday
[06:18:13] Marathon: dsaun's rhyme has a line about wooly tromping through snow, and ends with something like "ten thousand years of ko"
[06:51:45] GULFOSS: tahoe49 escaper
[06:52:42] Marathon: no public denunciations!   When players leave a game early: http://www.gokgs.com/help/faq/escapers.html  
[06:56:08] slb: No public accusations! Talk to an admin in private if you witness a problem on KGS. Escaper policy: http://www.gokgs.com/help/faq/escapers.html
[06:56:44] slb: the power of copy+paste
[06:58:06] alfalfa: Hallelujah!
[06:58:13] alfalfa: Amen!
[07:09:42] AmyTS: and warble!

[07:45:47] lithograph: does anyone know if EGR chat is archived?
[07:47:00] Eatwisdom: for everyone's sake i hope not
[07:50:43] Marathon: archived how far back?
[07:52:18] lithograph: since its birth ?
[07:52:53] Marathon: no, it's not archived that far back.
[07:53:14] Marathon: a few days, a week or so
[07:53:35] Marathon: why? do you want to recover some of dsaun's rhymes or other sayings?
[07:54:15] lithograph: I really wasn't familar with his poetry.
[07:54:27] lithograph: but that's what prompted my question
[07:54:45] Marathon: too bad we didn't think to save copies ourselves,
[07:55:25] lithograph: i was hoping to purchase a bound copy of the whole chat log, but i guess not possible
[07:58:22] Marathon: your best bet is to look in the games archives
[07:59:03] Marathon: but that's a lot of work.  especially if you are looking for what dsaun said in kibitz
[08:00:27] lithograph: I was imagining an archive of the whole kibitz as being a cool niche historical document
[08:01:16] Marathon: maybe the AGF can make it available.  i
[08:01:24] Marathon: i wonder how much space it takes up?
[08:02:26] lithograph: you think it exists somewhere behind an admin key?
[08:02:47] Marathon: it exists in a KGS server or servers
[08:03:53] lithograph: like all the way back? that's great.
[08:04:41] Marathon: wms used to be able to create a file or something that had all game headers from the archive -- date, time, white player, white rank, black player, black rank, handicap, komi, result -- no moves or chat
[08:05:01] Marathon: he would create it upon request when someone wanted to do some research
[08:07:03] lithograph: i thought game records and .sgfs were accessible, because that kgs analytics site can get them.
[08:07:27] Marathon: they are
[08:09:47] Marathon: almost every game of more than 10 moves played on KGS is there.
[08:10:35] Marathon: there are a few gaps. i assume the gaps are the result of crashes causing corrpution in the archives database.
[08:10:55] lithograph: How would you feel about a site that displayed every day of EGR kibitz? 
[08:11:17] lithograph: Would you think that as somehow intrusive?
[08:14:24] Marathon: i don't know that it would be useful. it would consume resources without good reason
[08:16:44] Marathon: maybe you could write to the AGF, and ask for a copy of the games archive
[08:17:02] Marathon: and then you can mine it for dsaun's chat
[08:17:51] Marathon: he had trouble with his hands late in life, and didn't like to type. so, for his teaching games, he used the microphone.  audio is not recorded in the archives.
[08:19:53] lithograph: i see that he was well liked. 
[08:21:05] lithograph: Thanks for answering my questions, Marathon.  gonna reinitiate 'lurk mode'.
[08:21:05] Marathon: he was indeed.
[08:21:34] Marathon: hmmm -- for some reason, when i try to access his oldest games from the archives, i get a "Forbidden" error
[08:49:15] radishimo: i can't imagine it being intrusive
[08:49:23] radishimo: chat logs are a thing for all sorts of reasons
[08:49:37] radishimo: i'd love to see the time i started an argument by asking maladroit why gravity happens
[08:49:41] radishimo: 5 people were banned
[08:51:06] marzo: oh the good old days
[08:51:46] radishimo: back when chemboy was still around
[08:52:11] radishimo: dsaun and i argued a lot but i liked to think of him as a friend anyway
[08:52:27] radishimo: i am very sad, he was a great guy
[08:52:51] marzo: he was a great guy
[09:19:05] didi: that world of the good old days is no more
[09:19:24] mongo: everythings changed
[09:27:39] marzo: in so many ways
[09:32:03] didi: no everything became as it always was inside
[09:34:29] didi: test of time brings out the truth, all of this is mirage
