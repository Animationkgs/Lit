Clements well andrew has always<br>been into comic books but now I think he<br>may have gone too far I think he's<br>losing touch<br>I mean he's writing events in his diary<br>that couldn't possibly have happened the<br>way he describes them you read your<br>son's diary No<br>oh of course not I don't read my son's<br>diary well it was an accident<br>anyway I'm worried that this little<br>world of superheroes that he lives in is<br>becoming real to him you've read<br>something by accident perhaps we can get<br>to my problems another time right now<br>let's just concentrate on Andrew well<br>andrew is a very energetic student he<br>may not always have his homework done on<br>time but he he certainly has creative<br>ways to get around it he has a wonderful<br>imagination that's what I'm afraid of<br>well if you're really concerned about<br>this the school retains a psychiatrist<br>who comes in whenever there's a student<br>who has a problem I can make an<br>appointment for Andrew with dr. Fox I<br>don't really know how he'll react to<br>that so who's coming for dinner uh his<br>name is mr. Fox I'm selling in my house<br>you mean like when you get your car<br>filled up with gas you get a free dish<br>no he's new in town and he's living<br>alone so I thought it might be nice to<br>have him over Oh<br>the way to a man's heart right Andrew<br>it's nothing like that<br>sure mom I you just leave it to me<br>so how do you kids like your school it's<br>okay but recess isn't long enough how<br>long would you like it to be any well<br>there are so many classes in between<br>then I sometimes forget what me and my<br>friends were talking about my friends<br>and I that happens to you too what about<br>you Andrew what do you think about<br>school I think a boy can get no finer<br>education than the one he receives from<br>his mother especially if the boy happens<br>to have a mother like mine it was kind<br>caring and loving to a fault thank you<br>Andrew<br>tell me Andrew what kind of hobbies does<br>a boy like you have comic books baseball<br>and try and keep my mother's boyfriend's<br>name Street pen uh comics oh yes I used<br>to love them when I was a kid yeah<br>who was your favorite spider-man<br>definitely spider-man you know I used to<br>have these great adventures where I<br>would pretend I was him I used to know<br>someone who did that really yeah his<br>parents sent them to a shrink<br>why is it every time I hello Erin<br>hi dr.
