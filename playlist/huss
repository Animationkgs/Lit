[22:02:09] FAX: yeah fermat was one of the coolest mathematician.
[22:02:52] FAX: in order to be cool, one must forget about a lot of things. Logic included.
[22:02:57] Marathon: if you have nothing to prove, why do you describe yourself as a mathematician, amateur or otherwise?
[22:03:04] FAX: which is why Epsilion could never be cool.
[22:03:42] alfalfa: he came this close!
[22:05:11] FAX: :D
[22:05:31] Hu: "All Cretans are liars," said the Cretan.
[22:05:40] Epsilion: besides meaning, sense and logic, sometimes an utterance is just plain stupid. like most of what FAX says
[22:06:08] Marathon: what is truth?   near the beginning of the textbook for a discrete math course i took, the author says she tries to avoid circular definitions. toward that end, she avoids defining "true" and "false" .
[22:06:44] roguehalo: is there anything such thing as infinite density?
[22:07:03] Hatate: looks into the egr, oh, there has 2 usernames which reminds me of "very nonsense"
[22:07:25] Agronski: Halo, that is what's in the middle of a black hole - an infinite density.
[22:08:34] roguehalo: hmm density is a discrete quantity by definition
[22:09:01] Hu: That's a mathematical idealization, Agronski.
[22:09:04] FAX: discrete mathematics is the most circular subject of all.
[22:09:14] Agronski: That's the definition of a singularity.
[22:09:24] roguehalo: there is a route via calculus from the discrete to the infinite but not in real life
[22:09:27] FAX: because we know basically nothing about it.
[22:09:31] Hu: What counts is the event horizon.  And the event horizon of a black hole has finite extent.
[22:09:55] Hu: "nothing"?  Nah
[22:10:22] FAX: name something Hu
[22:10:30] Hu: tree graphs
[22:10:55] FAX: oh, you mean spaghetti tree?
[22:11:16] Hu: No. Discrete graphs of nodes arranged as trees.
[22:11:20] FAX: the tree whereupon spaghetti spawns?
[22:11:23] roguehalo: youi cant have infinite density in real life which gives lie to the naked singularity
[22:11:56] FAX: graphs are usually delusional.
[22:12:04] LinuxGooo: Spaghetti trees would be fantastic invetion by nature. Always available in the garden for delicious pasta.
[22:12:16] Hu: Graphs have no thoughts, so they can't be delusional.
[22:12:18] roguehalo: or put it this way there is no route from infinite density to finite density  in real life
[22:12:39] FAX: graphs is a representation of numbers
[22:12:47] FAX: it is very much alive.
[22:12:51] Hu: Not necessarily.
[22:12:55] Hu: Graphs are not alive.
[22:13:12] LinuxGooo: infinte density is a conflict in itself I would say
[22:13:16] Hu: A graph, like a tree graph of a Demo go game.
[22:13:24] Hu: It's not alive.
[22:13:31] Hu: It doesn't represent numbers
[22:13:37] Hu: It's not delusional.
[22:13:39] FAX: Hu, you have no thought , so you better become delusional.
[22:13:52] ericj: Be nice, guys
[22:14:08] FAX: ericj, how dense are you?
[22:14:12] roguehalo: it doesnt exist its a contradiction to the concept of infinity which is never ending
[22:14:27] LinuxGooo: eric is low dense. lots of space between his atoms.
[22:14:37] ericj: FAX, I warned you already, be nice, ok?
[22:14:47] roguehalo: 'infinite density' implies you have got there
[22:15:03] FAX: i still can't imagine Hu said graphs are not live.
[22:15:04] roguehalo: you cant get there infinitely
[22:15:18] Hu: Graphs are not alive.
[22:15:23] LinuxGooo: I suppose you cant drill material with infinite density. Its like hitting a tresor wall.
[22:15:23] Epsilion: or else he'll baton you behind a dumpster FAX
[22:15:36] Hu: The map is not the territory.
[22:15:51] Hu: A graph can represent a live thing, but it is not alive.
[22:15:59] LinuxGooo: what are you talking about, guys ? Has it any relevance for life ?
[22:16:07] FAX: ericj, i am not going to insult anyone over a topic about thought.
[22:16:16] Hu: You already did.
[22:16:20] FAX: but for graphs i would.
[22:16:30] ericj: Good, FAX, then don't.
[22:16:31] LinuxGooo: Fax, you are insulting whenever your name appears in BOLD on my screen.
[22:16:33] FAX: Hu, will you forgive me please?
[22:16:39] Hu: Or at least attempted. It wasn't accepted.
[22:16:42] roguehalo: im proposing that the bing bang theory is a load of nonsense
[22:16:48] Hu: OK, you are forgiven.
[22:16:50] roguehalo: big even
[22:16:55] FAX: :)
[22:17:02] LinuxGooo: bing bang sounds sweet
[22:17:35] roguehalo: because it relies on a naked sigularity of infinite density
[22:18:02] FAX: guys, if insult is just about tarnishing someone's honor, then we are insulting each other constantly by playing the game of go.
[22:18:19] Hu: Learn the difference between infinite and "so large that it might as well be infinite without being infinite".
[22:18:23] roguehalo: and im saying you can only have infinite density mathematically and not in real life
[22:18:26] LinuxGooo: we tax payers finance such akward stuff called sciences in meta physics. High IQ folks spin around like crazy to think the impossible.
[22:18:48] LinuxGooo: my saying, roguehalo
[22:19:00] FAX: and there are literally more ways to insult someone at go than at any other thing, particularly the use of words.
[22:19:12] FAX: am i right, ericj?
[22:19:15] LinuxGooo: infinite possibilities of insulting.
[22:19:24] Hu: I am never insulted by losing a go game.
[22:19:25] FAX: correct, LinuxGooo.
[22:19:35] LinuxGooo: but you forget one factor, Fax.
[22:19:43] FAX: a tree of graphs of insult.
[22:19:57] LinuxGooo: your life time wont allow you to experience infinite insultings. you are limited badly.
[22:20:01] Hu: People may attempt insults in chat in Go, or by playing stupid moves on purpose, but if I get bored with such nonsense I just leave.
[22:20:15] FAX: discretely spirited via the channel of numbers.
[22:20:27] Marathon: there's a theory or the universe for which supporters claim the universe has no beginning, does not need dark matter, does not need dark energy, and singularities are impossible
[22:20:41] Hu: But if someone plays better than me, that is not an insult.
[22:20:51] FAX: Hu, yes we know, you are kind of a legend of "just leave" on kgs.
[22:21:00] LinuxGooo: today I had to play against a 7kyu he played crazy stuff. Either he had lack of sleep, took drugs, smoked something, was totally drunken, or he had a brain damage.
[22:21:17] Hu: i can't remember the last time I have had to leave a game early.
[22:21:44] FAX: ericj, what are your thoughts on insults generally?
[22:22:06] Hu: Don't expect an answer to a bogus question.
[22:22:11] LinuxGooo: Hu, if you play against someone who is better than you, than you might be the insult against your opponent maybe.
[22:22:20] roguehalo: well whats the difference between a point nothing that can explode into a universe and a point nothing that is well....just nothing?
[22:22:37] Hu: Possibly, LinuxGooo, but not by any purpose of mine.
[22:22:37] LinuxGooo: I have to say very often in my games "sorry" to my opponent, because I play so stupid.
[22:22:49] Hu: I've said that too.
[22:22:54] Agronski: If even Hawking and Penrose can't answer that, Halo, don't expect any better from KGS.
[22:23:05] LinuxGooo: I feel ashamed if I dont play good ... my opponent deserves the best I can play, so I see it.
[22:23:07] FAX: roguehalo, the differemce is one floods and the other thinks it is flooding.
[22:23:29] FAX: you see, the notion of thought is sharply defined.
[22:23:29] roguehalo: ahh well just saying :)
[22:23:53] Hu: Hu: Learn the difference between infinite and "so large that it might as well be infinite without being infinite". roguehalo.
[22:23:57] FAX: you cannot think if you are not required to think.
[22:24:16] LinuxGooo: sometimes I think, that I dont think ... :-)
[22:24:29] Hu: You can think even if there is no requirement to think.
[22:24:45] Hu: Thought police do not exist.
[22:24:51] roguehalo: hmm i think i know the difference.....it's the others that don't :P
[22:24:51] FAX: LinuxGooo, it sounds to me like you are going to be enlightened very soon.
[22:24:56] LinuxGooo: would be nice to have a switch off for the brain ... like "sleep modus", on passive standby.
[22:25:00] ericj: Well, I think some of them try, Hu. :)
[22:25:11] LinuxGooo: dont give me so much hope, Fax.
[22:25:31] FAX: i could tell you what a "sleep modulus" is though. It is thought itself.
[22:25:40] LinuxGooo: would be awesome experience. THen I write a book, and I become millionair. Enlightened pepole are well appreciated by the masses.
[22:25:52] FAX: much required, much defined.
[22:26:23] LinuxGooo: now you become philosophical (citiation: it thought itself)
[22:26:30] Hu: "sleep modulus" is a nonsense phrase that gets 8 (eight) hits on Google
[22:26:51] LinuxGooo: computers have "sleep modus", dont know ?
[22:27:15] LinuxGooo: to avoid electric power consumption.
[22:27:16] Hu: "modus" and "modulus" are very different.
[22:27:31] FAX: ok folks, it's getting dark here in china, and there's nothing i fear more than the dark.
[22:27:33] LinuxGooo: modulus sounds like a technic of a cook
[22:27:47] LinuxGooo: fear the bats, fax. they have covid-19
[22:28:13] LinuxGooo: chinese bats transferred covid19 to humans, isnt ?
[22:29:36] alfalfa: modulus is an arithmetic term
[22:29:53] alfalfa: like if it's thirteen o'clock
[22:29:58] LinuxGooo: the ISS was built by modules
[22:30:15] alfalfa: we don't say 13 o'clock, it resets
[22:30:57] alfalfa: so the hours are numbered "with a modulus of twelve"
[22:31:00] LinuxGooo: in Central europe we say 13:00 o`clock, alfalfa. maybe not in USA:
[22:31:21] LinuxGooo: so modulus is periodic ?
[22:31:21] alfalfa: i could give other examples
[22:31:26] alfalfa: yes
[22:31:55] Hu: One area is modulus 12 another area is modulus 24. Still modulus arithmetic.
[22:31:55] alfalfa: it's just a name for the concept
[22:32:09] Agronski: *modulo
[22:32:09] roguehalo: modulus is an absolute value or constant factor
[22:32:17] alfalfa: yes
[22:32:23] roguehalo: google knows everything :P
[22:32:32] LinuxGooo: in music its called rythm. :-)
[22:32:36] Hu: Yes, Agronski, usually stated like "modulo 12"
[22:32:49] Agronski: %)
[22:32:55] Agronski: </visual pun>
[22:33:14] LinuxGooo: world is complicated
[22:33:15] alfalfa: or "mod 12" as all the young hipsters are saying
[22:33:39] LinuxGooo: for what do young hipsters need a modulus of 12 ?
[22:33:46] alfalfa: mods
[22:33:48] alfalfa: rockers
[22:33:51] alfalfa: it was a thing
[22:33:58] alfalfa: in the 1960s
[22:34:06] alfalfa: beatle-boots
[22:34:06] LinuxGooo: with these chrome scooters
[22:34:08] alfalfa: the who
[22:34:14] Agronski: Kicking the hell out of those damn scooter-riding nogoodniks down in Brighton.
[22:34:22] LinuxGooo: isnt the right term "Mot" ?
[22:34:24] LinuxGooo: with t
[22:34:24] alfalfa: you remember!
[22:34:35] roguehalo: hmm i was a beatnik/hippy in the 60s
[22:34:36] ericj: I remember Mot and Yob.
[22:34:37] Hu: modded hot rod
[22:34:38] LinuxGooo: I have seen a movie about the Mots.... too crazy. I didnt like these fashion guys.
[22:34:59] LinuxGooo: I prefer rocker
[22:35:04] roguehalo: i also played go in the 60s
[22:35:09] Hu: Quadrophenia
[22:35:14] LinuxGooo: cant be, roguehalo
[22:35:18] Agronski: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079766
[22:35:19] LinuxGooo: then you should be dead now.
[22:35:22] Hu: ... by the Who.
[22:35:42] roguehalo: well im getting on a bit :P
[22:36:00] alfalfa: Whom i had previously mentioned.
[22:36:19] LinuxGooo: I think to remember this movie.
[22:36:29] LinuxGooo: but I didnt like it.
[22:36:55] LinuxGooo: too much "thinking in the box"
[22:37:01] Hu: The movie was a bit of a dud. The album is phenomenally good.
[22:37:07] roguehalo: it was pretty boring
[22:37:23] roguehalo: bit of a cult movie at the time
[22:37:40] LinuxGooo: yes.... cult... bad cult.
[22:38:01] alfalfa: i liked "the kids are all right", it was more of a documentary
[22:38:31] LinuxGooo: its akward to pimp a scooter.
[22:38:31] alfalfa: more musical
[22:38:44] roguehalo: well ofc back then teens were a threat to civilisation
[22:39:30] LinuxGooo: its over .... these times may not come back.
[22:40:28] roguehalo: i mean the rolling stones were regarded as practically a reincarnation of the devil
[22:40:51] alfalfa: well, they milked that bad-boy image, too
[22:40:55] roguehalo: at the time
[22:41:00] LinuxGooo: if you look at keith richards face, it might be right.
[22:41:27] alfalfa: i mean one of their albums was called "Their Satanic Majesties' Request"
[22:41:31] roguehalo: i hapened to be in jail in the 60s
[22:41:37] roguehalo: happened
[22:41:40] alfalfa: they kind of flaunted that idea
[22:41:41] LinuxGooo: jail ?
[22:41:58] roguehalo: and in the next cell to me was keith richards
[22:42:00] LinuxGooo: only know elvis and jail house rock.
[22:42:28] alfalfa: oh the famous bust of the rolling stones?
[22:42:34] roguehalo: yep
[22:42:41] alfalfa: we are not worthy.
[22:42:45] LinuxGooo: its abnormal they are still alive.
[22:43:00] roguehalo: smoking dope was a very serious offence back then
[22:43:11] LinuxGooo: such guys normally have an airplane crash or so ... to become immortal.
[22:43:12] alfalfa: in england
[22:43:52] LinuxGooo: a super rock star should not become older than 32
[22:43:57] alfalfa: it was a conservative newspaper (daily mail?) that came to their defense
[22:44:20] alfalfa: they were tried in the court of public opinion, and basically exonerated of any wrongdoing
[22:44:20] roguehalo: i met brian jones in a club
[22:44:32] alfalfa: then they became knights of the realm!
[22:44:36] roguehalo: he was with mynah bird
[22:44:49] roguehalo: his girlfriend at the time
[22:44:52] LinuxGooo: did the queen gave them the "Sir" title ?
[22:45:13] alfalfa: jagger and richards both, i think
[22:45:26] LinuxGooo: drug junkies, with "Sir" title... bravo.
[22:45:51] alfalfa: it's about the money
[22:46:11] alfalfa: rich people can do whatever they want to do
[22:46:32] LinuxGooo: I think, its more about "Se.... dr..... a.... ro...n ro.... "
[22:46:58] LinuxGooo: they only can do it because they can pay very expensive lawyers .
[22:47:07] LinuxGooo: lto pull them out of their problems.
[22:51:29] roguehalo: back in the 60s i was 4k
[22:51:58] roguehalo: 50 yearsd later at the age of 75 im 5k
[22:52:50] mongo: i went to my first us go congress in denver in the 90s as a aga 1d
[22:53:06] mongo: and thats what i am now :P
[22:53:30] roguehalo: jon diamond was the uk champion the time he was 4d as i remembert
[22:53:52] roguehalo: at
[23:00:33] highhand: rengo up, join w your friend and go away with deeper bonding at end of game
[23:01:33] LinuxGooo: what you think is the reason you kept on your kyu level, roguehalo ?
[23:01:58] LinuxGooo: (but first let me say that I appreciate it to see you still playing Go at the age of 75)
[23:03:56] alfalfa: we could start a room, say "silver foxes" for those of us who are above a certain age.
[23:04:09] alfalfa: but we'd probably forget how to find it
[23:04:29] N9DP: I'd join that room
[23:04:29] alfalfa: "i know that room was around here somewhere...."
[23:04:31] ericj: in athletics, it's called "masters" when you're, ahem, aged
[23:04:43] ericj: and starts at 35-40
[23:05:03] N9DP: I'm like a fine wine that gets better with age
[23:05:26] alfalfa: my whine gets better with age, too.
[23:05:38] ericj: I don't drink too many fine winges though
[23:06:53] LinuxGooo: lots of wine in the Silver Fox cellar.
[23:07:22] LinuxGooo: I drink portwine ... preferrible
[23:07:43] LinuxGooo: because its the single type of wine you can transport on shaky sailing ships.
[23:08:03] alfalfa: the fizzy stuff is no good
[23:08:05] LinuxGooo: in the sense of... it wont turn into vinegar during the trip
[23:08:38] arndt: port = liquid raisins
[23:08:59] roguehalo: well im a alchoholic
[23:09:08] LinuxGooo: portwine was created by the British during times of war with napoleon. The officers on their war ships still wanted drink wine on board ... but needed a seaworthy wine. So they mixed it with brandy.
[23:09:09] roguehalo: dunno if that helps
[23:09:45] alfalfa: i don't generally drink wine, and i don't smoke tobacco any longer... but if i had a glass of port, i would have to smoke a cigar too
[23:10:04] roguehalo: i stopped smoking at 40
[23:10:18] roguehalo: but i carried on drinking
[23:10:23] LinuxGooo: ... and as the wine regular came from France, it was prohibited during war with Napoleon to be exported to U.K. So the British produced port wine in Portugal.
[23:11:10] Hu: I wouldn't want starboard wine.
[23:11:26] LinuxGooo: Till today Portwine is only allowed to be produced in Portugal, as it needs a certificate by the Institute for Portwine
[23:11:40] alfalfa: i know it is not "good wine" but i used to like portuguese rose
[23:11:46] LinuxGooo: Porto is the haven where all the port wines arrive from the wineyards.
[23:11:47] alfalfa: what was that called
[23:11:51] alfalfa: Mateus
[23:11:58] roguehalo: shiraz is my wine of choice atm
[23:12:14] roguehalo: with malbec a close second
[23:12:14] LinuxGooo: uh .... port wine not a good wine ??? Oh, Lord..... its highest quality.
[23:12:26] alfalfa: no the rose
[23:12:40] LinuxGooo: yeah, the Rose has a bad image. kind of.
[23:12:42] roguehalo: hmm port isn't a wine :P
[23:12:46] LinuxGooo: but I think nowadays its good quality.
[23:13:13] LinuxGooo: port wine is based on red wine or white wine, and mixed with brandy.
[23:13:36] ericj: a fortified wine, as it's called
[23:13:38] roguehalo: well its a wine thats been mucked about
[23:13:45] LinuxGooo: haha
[23:13:51] LinuxGooo: I like the taste
[23:13:52] alfalfa: that's why i need the cigar
[23:14:07] ericj: the best part is there is something for every taste in the wine world, I think
[23:14:11] roguehalo: goes well with stilton
[23:14:21] ericj: oooooh agree roguehalo
[23:14:30] LinuxGooo: so if you should be invited by a captain to come on board, dont buy a normal wine as gift. Bring a bottle of good portwine. and you make the crew happy.
[23:15:00] alfalfa: thanks for the tip, Cap'n.
[23:15:18] LinuxGooo: :-)
[23:15:46] roguehalo: does the captain still play here
[23:15:56] ericj: from time to time, roguehalo
[23:16:13] roguehalo: was a very entertaining 4d a few years ago
[23:16:24] DuhCaptain: haven't seen him for a while...
[23:16:29] roguehalo: had a bit of a cult following
[23:16:41] alfalfa: i dislike sweet wines especially
[23:16:45] LinuxGooo: ah ... I remember. yes.
[23:17:03] ericj: only about a game a month lately, but quite a bit more in jan and feb
[23:18:16] Chris: ah spring
[23:18:46] roguehalo: mind you back in the day games here could have 150+ spectators
[23:19:02] roguehalo: or even more
[23:23:33] Jarndyce: that was quite a time ago.
[23:25:11] LinuxGooo: yeah, yeah .... earlier times... all was much better than now
[23:25:19] LinuxGooo: haha...
[23:28:32] mongo: when i was a boy i had to showshoe 20 km to school
[23:28:38] mongo: summer and winter..
[23:29:07] mongo: the snow was soo deep back then
[23:29:08] Eliza: uphill both ways?
[23:29:24] mongo: and the wind was alway against you
[23:29:57] roguehalo: ?
[23:30:14] mongo: actually i know the capn..
[23:30:33] mongo: back in the day there used to be an active go scene
[23:30:52] mongo: in coffee shops in seatle and vancouver
[23:31:21] mongo: i mean coffee houses
[23:31:44] mongo: they were different from coffee shops now..
[23:32:16] alfalfa: i went to a go congress in seattle
[23:32:25] mongo: people would go there in the evenings listen to music and be groovie
[23:33:03] mongo: there was one in takoma..
[23:33:28] LinuxGooo: never seen go players in Netherlands in coffee shops. ;-)
[23:34:04] mongo: online go killed a lot of the live go venues
[23:34:16] LinuxGooo: NL is famous forits coffee shops. you know what I mean ? ;-)
[23:34:32] mongo: did i feel a nudge?
[23:35:04] alfalfa: yeah, amsterdam is nice,  good coffee.
[23:35:11] LinuxGooo: I poke in eyes, mongo.
[23:35:53] mongo: you could say taht about portland or
[23:36:11] mongo: i went to a go congress there :)
[23:38:40] Pastramima: Somebody sent me a message, but I forgot to check it before logging out, anyway to recover it?
[23:40:50] Eliza: only if it's offensive
[23:41:56] Pastramima: I'm sure it was offensive
[23:43:14] JIeBuc: then you don't need to recover it :D
[23:46:15] Now: it´s kinda rude not to resign when you have to
[23:48:35] Pastramima: Not recovering it would be tripple offensive... an admin was so kind to point me to the sender
[23:48:49] Pastramima: so the mystery can be solved :D
[23:49:03] JIeBuc: I see, so it can be recovered
[23:49:43] Pastramima: maybe, at least participants can be identified I guess. Quite interesting indeed
[23:52:43] Danny2011: hi

[00:25:02] stayhome: i have a question. what should i do when my opponnent wouldn't click "done" after we marked all the dead stones?
[00:25:22] Kisame361: you wait until they do or u just sit it out until they abandon the game
[00:25:35] Kisame361: after i think 72 hours u will be declared the winner by defaukt
[00:26:01] stayhome: so i can just leave the game?
[00:26:32] stayhome: he is still there for a long time but refuse to click done
[00:31:09] alfalfa: let's all join stayhome's game and mock his opponent
[00:31:28] alfalfa: oh, that's no good, the players can't see the kibitz
[00:35:25] Kisame361: no
[00:35:37] Kisame361: dont leavce the game or ull be the escaper
[00:35:49] Kisame361: just leave thge window open wait till he times out or disappears from the game
[00:35:58] Tyranosaur: stayhome, you contact an admin
[00:36:07] Tyranosaur: they have stars
[00:42:38] Danny2011: ????????????????????????????????????????

[00:44:23] JIeBuc: it's not november
[00:44:27] JIeBuc: so not wut is not happening
[00:44:28] ericj: You'll need to ask something more specific so we can help you. Otherwise, it's just chat.
[00:45:59] alfalfa: no.   no, it's not.
[00:47:58] ericj: never JUST chat, eh, alfalfa? :)
[00:48:30] Danny2011: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah lost agaian
[00:49:43] wanchan: dany we have female chess league
[00:49:53] wanchan: just for u check it out

[00:54:02] wanchan: zzz
[00:54:26] SanYuan: why people afriad of paying with [?]
[00:54:40] ericj: they sometimes misrepresent their skill, SanYuan.
[00:54:41] JIeBuc: people are afraid of unknown
[00:54:57] wanchan: most are just sandbaggin right
[00:55:14] ericj: certainly not most: new players just need a few games to establish rank.
[00:55:45] wanchan: u ever make a new account eric?
[00:56:06] ericj: not since 2003, wanchan, but I did have to get my rank back a couple of times.
[00:56:16] wanchan: right right
[00:56:54] SanYuan: I see ty.. guess new players wil need to use bots
[00:57:05] wanchan: it's the only way
[00:57:16] wanchan: just lose two and you'll  be on ur way
[00:57:18] ericj: not necessarily, but typing in the chat box, explaining your strength in your custom game setup, etc -- all can help
[00:57:25] ericj: you have to win two as well, wanchan.
[00:57:36] wanchan: well that's the easy part
[00:57:57] ericj: losing to certain bots will get you deranked, too -- please don't lose to idiotbot, for example
[00:57:58] wanchan: because nobody plays you if you have ?`
[00:58:43] wanchan: just tryin to help brah
[00:58:59] wanchan: kgs rank aint easy

[01:59:18] LinuxGooo: aha .... I am not in poems. Not so my world ;-)
[01:59:50] alfalfa: Darmok and Jalaad at Tanagra.
[01:59:50] Agronski: *braille
[02:00:23] LinuxGooo: I think to remember that there exist braille Go games.
[02:01:04] OoooWeee: you mean blind go?
[02:01:59] alfalfa: another name for go, used mostly by housewives, is "will you get off that danged computer and do some work around here>"
[02:03:10] LinuxGooo: no, not blind go... go boards for blind people... look like this http://www.kmp.co.kr/viewproduct_1_e.html
[02:03:27] LinuxGooo: they can feel the contures of the grid ...
[02:03:39] alfalfa: textures
[02:03:59] Hu: https://senseis.xmp.net/?Shudan @LinuxGooo re hand talk
[02:05:37] LinuxGooo: .. and also the stones can have different shapes instead of colours ... http://www.braillebookstore.com/Tic--Tac--Toe,-Plastic.1
[02:06:47] Hu: Rotted axe handle:  https://senseis.xmp.net/?Ranka
[02:07:08] alfalfa: right!
[02:07:10] alfalfa: ranka
[02:07:17] alfalfa: another name
[02:07:36] alfalfa: go was called "rotten axe handle"
[02:07:50] alfalfa: because of a story
[02:08:00] alfalfa: about a wood-cutter
[02:08:13] alfalfa: who went into the woods
[02:08:14] LinuxGooo: nice article, Hu. Tks. read it with joy.
[02:08:55] mongo: i have the same ax that my great great grand father used
[02:09:21] alfalfa: replaced the handle three times and the head twice
[02:09:25] LinuxGooo: Lets have a "hand discussion" .... I like that. ;-)
[02:09:57] alfalfa: now, do you know the story of "rip van winkle"?
[02:10:00] LinuxGooo: so its no more the original ax, mongo.
[02:10:33] alfalfa: it is the same story as "rotten axe-handle"
[02:10:47] Agronski: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiff_des_Theseus
[02:10:52] Agronski: Read that, Linux.
[02:11:39] LinuxGooo: so many links as gift .... guys, I have not yet birthday ... its coming close, but not today. ;-)
[02:11:49] LinuxGooo: tks
[02:12:01] Insight: am i 4k
[02:12:04] Insight: nope
[02:12:09] Insight: i won 14 straight
[02:12:18] Insight: waiting to boom level up
[02:12:55] alfalfa: it depends upon whom you've beaten
[02:13:26] alfalfa: if they were a bunch of no-talent wimps, what's so cool about beating them?
[02:13:32] mongo: it looks like you are
[02:13:53] mongo: i think you rating may have reached over 4k
[02:14:05] LinuxGooo: that shipyard owner was smart who got the deal from Theseus. ;-) I like this guy.
[02:15:09] LinuxGooo: Insight ... I won 9 of 10 ... and no boom level up for me. Just maybe 15-20%within same rank as seen in the graph. So dont wake up and be disappointed if you are not boosted into 3kyu sky .
[02:15:45] LinuxGooo: but enjoy the time to be on the winner street. it wont stay forever.
[02:16:17] alfalfa: i'm just happy that nobody is dropping flaming Napalm on me
[02:16:32] LinuxGooo: isnt it banned since Vietnam war ?
[02:16:44] alfalfa: like that would stop them
[02:18:08] mongo: wasnt that agent orange?
[02:18:30] LinuxGooo: in ship restoration a fully rebuilt of the original is seen to become a "new ship". E.g. old wooden ship build in the 19th century... it would have a higher prize than building a new one.
[02:18:58] LinuxGooo: because of the historic value
[02:19:40] Agronski: Agent orange was a defoliant. Napalm is an incendiary.
[02:20:44] alfalfa: worst band name ever.. "the flaming napalms"
[02:23:26] LinuxGooo: barometer fell dramatically down to 1000 mb. In NL we get storm this night. already very shaky... On Weekend we get windspeed up to 40 knots. Got so cold again.
[02:23:49] LinuxGooo: good conditions to play GO.
[02:23:57] alfalfa: it's like you are now getting the weather i had two days ago
[02:24:09] alfalfa: it's moving around the globe
[02:24:30] alfalfa: but it's very warm now
[02:24:47] LinuxGooo: haha.... it wont harm me. I love nature elements.
[02:25:07] LinuxGooo: 12 degrees C during night. So warm air is gone.
[02:27:02] VIXX: it's summer, stop saying it's cold
[02:27:55] LinuxGooo: official start is in 17 days. I am not allowed to call it so. Its still spring.
[02:28:48] LinuxGooo: :-)
[02:29:52] VIXX: even better
[02:30:21] LinuxGooo: you like spring more than summer ?
[02:31:40] Now: spring smells like pheromones
[02:31:46] LinuxGooo: The blossing of nature is beautiful in spring.
[02:32:29] LinuxGooo: yeah, yeah ... and falling in love, pinky glasses, butterflies in the belly etc. ... drives humans crazy.
[02:32:59] Now: the mating season
