[20:35:28] alfalfa: no
[20:36:00] kindred: they teach english, and other normal subjects there too
[20:36:02] LinuxGooo: would like to get the answer from kindred, as he has personal experiences to live in this "dief world". I neaver had fairly to say.
[20:36:21] kindred: but the signing itself, there's really no relation
[20:36:38] LinuxGooo: has your visual senses developed higher than that of normal people. would you say so, kindred ?
[20:37:09] ericj: ok :)
[20:37:26] kindred: no, i think it's still the same as anyone else, but developed to notice things differently
[20:37:37] LinuxGooo: in what way ?
[20:38:42] kindred: some languages are tonal... and people who don't speak them natively, they have harder time hearing the differences in between tones
[20:38:48] LinuxGooo: would like to produce a radio show about this topic. As Mr. Spok would say: Fascinating.
[20:38:49] kindred: that kind of thing
[20:39:17] ericj: even harder to produce them, good point
[20:39:21] LinuxGooo: oh ... so even you are deaf, you have a higher sensitivity for tones ?
[20:39:33] kindred: in signs, sure
[20:39:43] LinuxGooo: wowh ....
[20:40:05] kindred: most people who are new to sign, have difficulty in noticing the differences in between "9" and "F" in signs
[20:40:36] kindred: or "D" and "1"
[20:41:12] LinuxGooo: I see ....
[20:41:30] kindred: especially when they're signed at normal speed
[20:41:43] LinuxGooo: similar for us humans to hear in a language if it is a "k" or a "c" spoken.
[20:42:02] LinuxGooo: sometimes it sounds nearby the same, but only nearby.
[20:42:06] ericj: which, let me guess, is super fast appearing to a new signer
[20:42:37] kindred: just normal speed
[20:42:42] LinuxGooo: on some TV channels they have also a sign interpreter who translates the news ... thats all what I know about this sign language.
[20:42:44] kindred: even a little bit slower
[20:42:59] ericj: I'm saying, to a beginner, normal speed seems fast
[20:43:07] ericj: as in with spoken languages?
[20:43:35] LinuxGooo: maybe my last question to this interesting topic ... I could go on and on asking ... pls dont see it as unpolite. So just one more if you allow: What would be worth from the Non deaf world to learn from this "deaf culture" ? What should we learn from ?
[20:44:09] LinuxGooo: witj "we" I mean the "hearing world"
[20:44:13] LinuxGooo: with*
[20:44:24] kindred: deaf people have different experiences with life than hearing people
[20:44:32] kindred: and a culture developed around that
[20:44:32] portalis: that there are other way to convey a message than just the words ^^
[20:44:51] alfalfa: i've always wondered about that american indian sign language... is that real, or was it just made up for the movies?
[20:44:56] LinuxGooo: hearing people have also body language. so its not just bla, bla, bla .... talking.
[20:45:26] kindred: native americans had a system of sign language
[20:45:41] LinuxGooo: should both cultures interact more deeply, kindred ? I mean... the hearing world and the deaf world.
[20:45:46] kindred: from what i know they used it to communicate with people from different tribes
[20:46:07] LinuxGooo: yeah ... English speaking Indians in Hollywood movies. thats so akward.
[20:46:26] kindred: linuxgo, yes, it's always good when different people interact with each other
[20:46:30] portalis: i ve heard of whistling language
[20:46:31] LinuxGooo: some even with British English accent. Thats so trustworthy.
[20:47:38] LinuxGooo: so for you to communicate here via text chat is that OK, kindred ? Or would you prefer a video channel where also the hearing people have learnt your sign language and then communicate visually ?
[20:48:53] kindred: i'm here all the time... i wouldn't be if it wasn't ok
[20:50:43] kindred: also, i think the older i got, i started to feel uncomfortable pushing my views on others... so i'm less comfortable talking about deaf issues with just anyone
[20:50:49] kindred: compared to when i was younger
[20:51:49] LinuxGooo: Its also good so it sounds for me, that it becomes more a kind of "normality" for you. So no need to talk a lot about. Seems you found your place in this "world of sounds" :-)
[20:52:40] Marathon: a reporter asked helen keller if it was worse being blind or being deaf -- she replied it was worse being deaf:  blindness separated her from things; deafness speparated her from people
[20:53:00] kindred: helen keller is a bit controversial with some deaf people
[20:53:03] LinuxGooo: But you can be a supporter for the young deaf kids and teenagers maybe, it always should be a collaboration between different generations.
[20:53:42] kindred: from what i know, helen keller was born deaf and blind... so she had no comparison to make, really
[20:54:00] LinuxGooo: but there are studies, that blind people are less aggressive, than deaf people. Why ? Because the hearing gives you still a 3D image of your surrounding. It is more easy to orientate yourself as blind person. So I read about.
[20:54:23] Marathon: she was born seeing and hearing.
[20:54:33] kindred: i think some deaf people are aggressive because of communication issues
[20:54:56] kindred: imagine if people don't want to hear what you say, all the time
[20:55:07] Marathon: but, she contracted a serious illness shortly before her 2nd birthday -- scarlet fever, IIRC
[20:55:15] kindred: 2 year old is very young
[20:55:21] Marathon: yup
[20:55:31] kindred: i became deaf when i was 2, and i don't even remember hearing
[20:55:49] youtuber: my name is ewuhdfnrjdjfc
[20:57:23] LinuxGooo: there are some cool videos on youtube showing deaf people who can hear first time by this brain implantant... when the specialist switches it on ... and the person gets a first audio signal in brain, its very, very emotional. I think its a cochlear implant.
[20:57:59] LinuxGooo: but I dont know if it can be helpfully for every kind of deafness.
[20:58:08] Marathon: cochlear implant
[20:58:10] kindred: i have quite a few friends who got cochlear implant, and many of them has it turned off
[20:58:20] LinuxGooo: oh................. really ?
[20:58:23] LinuxGooo: wowh.
[20:58:44] LinuxGooo: hm ... this world is tooo noisy, hm ???
[20:58:45] kindred: i had a friend who was the second child to get one
[20:58:49] kindred: he doesn't use it anymore
[20:58:59] LinuxGooo: haha ..... I would say, you have a wise friend.
[20:59:05] Hu: A bit of a waste of money and opportunity?  There are others who would like to get the implants.
[20:59:25] LinuxGooo: stop to hear all this stupid bla, bla, bla .... just switch it off....... peacefully silence ......
[20:59:41] kindred: yes, but it seems not everyone appreciates having one
[20:59:52] kindred: or find it helpful
[20:59:55] LinuxGooo: you dont know your own emotional, intellectual and physical reaction in advance, Hu. Its like the egg and chicken problem.
[21:00:18] Hu: Also, doesn't it get better the more it is used?  The nerves have to grow and the brain has to learn to makes sense of the new impulses.
[21:00:31] Hu: Maybe they turned it off too early.
[21:00:42] kindred: this guy told me that every time he goes through security gate he gets a bad headache
[21:00:59] kindred: the kind that for preventing theft, at shopping mall
[21:01:28] LinuxGooo: oh, yes.... metal detector rings ........ smuggler smuggles IT high tech hidden in the brain ... hehe.
[21:01:57] LGSam: What about music?
[21:02:14] kindred: i also met the first child to get one, but didn't really know him well
[21:02:40] LinuxGooo: there is a very, very famous deaf percussionist, you know her ?????? She is awesome. She feels the drums and music with her body. Not with her ears ... you wanna listen ????
[21:02:41] kindred: i don't know about that, lgsam
[21:03:10] LGSam: Somebody should show them Buckethead's "Soothesayer"
[21:03:11] LinuxGooo: Evelyn Glennie from Scottland ... she is great.
[21:03:13] kindred: cochlear implant doesn't transmit all of the frequencies
[21:03:19] JIeBuc: imagine how sensitive is her body
[21:03:22] LGSam: I'd wonder if they switch it off then...
[21:03:22] kindred: only those used for speaking
[21:03:29] Marathon: in the movie "children of a lesser god", the deaf people liked to dance -- they turned the music volume up so they could feel the vibrations
[21:03:29] JIeBuc: and what happens when she gets massage
[21:03:48] LGSam: ah I see kindred
[21:04:03] LinuxGooo: She spoke on TED about her "listening skills" as deaf percussionist... its awesome ... watch it ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU3V6zNER4g
[21:06:00] LinuxGooo: its great you share your experiences, kindred. I appreciate it.
[21:06:15] kindred: it's no problem
[21:06:45] LinuxGooo: I like the silence in GO !! :-)
[21:08:11] LinuxGooo: Thats why I enjoy to go to tournaments. There playing long games of 1-1.5 hours playtime. Its in total maybe 2-3 hours .... just thining about GO. Nothing else. No thought flashes through the mind. I can be very calm during a tournament, so long my opponent does not like to kill and crush me badly *laugh*
[21:08:25] LinuxGooo: thinking*
[21:12:34] kkij: games are for children not for adults. adults do constructive work.
[21:12:57] Agronski: [citation needed]
[21:13:22] kkij: the thought of winning or losing is the voices of the barnyard animals
[21:13:41] ericj: kkij, did you come here just to troll, or what?
[21:14:07] kkij: if you call the truth trolling, ericj
[21:14:11] kkij: the ducks the geese the chickens and pigs before they are cooked and whose flesh is served to the master of the house
[21:14:34] kkij: wining or losing is idleness in the end
[21:14:56] kkij: is it not true what I said?
[21:15:11] ericj: enough flooding, kkij
[21:15:18] JIeBuc: Speaking honestly, I consider games as one of the main reasons for inventions
[21:15:45] kkij: yes i will respect the tos
[21:15:48] Marathon: can nonsense be true or false?
[21:16:37] Xorax: if its true or false, its not nonsense
[21:16:48] Epsilion: 4 consecutive lines is considered flooding now?
[21:16:52] ericj: sort of by definitino, right, Xorax?
[21:17:22] Epsilion: my how the times have changed
[21:17:45] Marathon: but that doesn't answer my question
[21:17:49] Xorax: hmm?
[21:18:03] JIeBuc: degree of flooding depends on content
[21:18:19] Agronski: First order logic. First define "nonsense" - do you mean logically inconsistent, or logically contradictory.
[21:19:04] Marathon: something that has no meaning
[21:19:06] Epsilion: the answer is that no, nonsense cannot be true or false
[21:19:08] FAX: flood is just economics.
[21:19:19] JIeBuc: why it can't?
[21:19:21] FAX: when there is more supply than demand, there's the flood.
[21:19:24] FAX: like in china.
[21:19:39] Epsilion: it expresses no proposition, nothing to be evaluated as true or false
[21:19:55] Marathon: well, that's what i thought.  thanks.
[21:20:06] FAX: no, it's never about logic.
[21:20:41] JIeBuc: nonsense is like chaos. It just exist
[21:20:43] Agronski: "No meaning" doesn't mean anything in Boolean logic, unless you extend it to include "undefined"
[21:20:43] FAX: chicken comes before egg.
[21:20:58] FAX: as does demand before supply
[21:21:17] FAX: when one does it the other way round, then flood is born.
[21:21:24] Epsilion: Is "Twas bryllyg, and ye slythy toves Did gyre and gymble in ye wabe" true or false?
[21:21:41] JIeBuc: it's true, because it exist
[21:21:52] Epsilion: no
[21:22:16] Agronski: First define your terms. Is Jabberwocky supposed to code a logical assertion?
[21:22:21] Epsilion: it expresses nothing; has no sense, no meaning
[21:22:36] Agronski: Linguistically it has meaning. Logically it does not. These are different spaces.
[21:22:58] PoorYorick: well, that depends if it was brillig or not, and if the slithy toves did or did not gyre and gimble in the wabe
[21:22:59] JIeBuc: in other words, true or false depends on subjective interpretation?
[21:23:40] Epsilion: linguistically it has no meaning; tell us what it means. it's poetry, intended by Carol to be nonsense
[21:24:48] ericj: agronski is pointing out the difference between linguistic and logical meaning.
[21:24:58] ericj: nonsense verse is a special kind of nonsense, one of my favorites :)
[21:25:33] Epsilion: a sentence can be meaningful, but also be logically inconsistent. a sentence with no meaning whatsoever cannot be true, false or inconsistent
[21:26:24] Agronski: Such a sentence would need to be a random string of words, but that is accurate.
[21:26:47] PoorYorick: not _any_ random string :·P
[21:26:58] Epsilion: "I exist and I don't exist"
[21:27:35] Epsilion: it's not meaningless, in fact it is meaningful but also a logical contradiction. so, we can say that it is false
[21:28:31] Agronski: Depending on the logic family, contradiction may imply truth, but in any case, it can be said to have a logical value, yes.

[21:12:57] Agronski: [citation needed]
[21:13:22] kkij: the thought of winning or losing is the voices of the barnyard animals
[21:13:41] ericj: kkij, did you come here just to troll, or what?
[21:14:07] kkij: if you call the truth trolling, ericj
[21:14:11] kkij: the ducks the geese the chickens and pigs before they are cooked and whose flesh is served to the master of the house
[21:14:34] kkij: wining or losing is idleness in the end
[21:14:56] kkij: is it not true what I said?
[21:15:11] ericj: enough flooding, kkij
[21:15:18] JIeBuc: Speaking honestly, I consider games as one of the main reasons for inventions
[21:15:45] kkij: yes i will respect the tos 
[21:15:48] Marathon: can nonsense be true or false? 
[21:16:37] Xorax: if its true or false, its not nonsense
[21:16:48] Epsilion: 4 consecutive lines is considered flooding now?
[21:16:52] ericj: sort of by definitino, right, Xorax? 
[21:17:22] Epsilion: my how the times have changed
[21:17:45] Marathon: but that doesn't answer my question
[21:17:49] Xorax: hmm?
[21:18:03] JIeBuc: degree of flooding depends on content
[21:18:19] Agronski: First order logic. First define "nonsense" - do you mean logically inconsistent, or logically contradictory.
[21:19:04] Marathon: something that has no meaning 
[21:19:06] Epsilion: the answer is that no, nonsense cannot be true or false
[21:19:08] FAX: flood is just economics.
[21:19:19] JIeBuc: why it can't?
[21:19:21] FAX: when there is more supply than demand, there's the flood.
[21:19:24] FAX: like in china.
[21:19:39] Epsilion: it expresses no proposition, nothing to be evaluated as true or false
[21:19:55] Marathon: well, that's what i thought.  thanks.
[21:20:06] FAX: no, it's never about logic.
[21:20:41] JIeBuc: nonsense is like chaos. It just exist
[21:20:43] Agronski: "No meaning" doesn't mean anything in Boolean logic, unless you extend it to include "undefined"
[21:20:43] FAX: chicken comes before egg.
[21:20:58] FAX: as does demand before supply
[21:21:17] FAX: when one does it the other way round, then flood is born.
[21:21:24] Epsilion: Is "Twas bryllyg, and ye slythy toves Did gyre and gymble in ye wabe" true or false?
[21:21:41] JIeBuc: it's true, because it exist
[21:21:52] Epsilion: no
[21:22:16] Agronski: First define your terms. Is Jabberwocky supposed to code a logical assertion?
[21:22:21] Epsilion: it expresses nothing; has no sense, no meaning
[21:22:36] Agronski: Linguistically it has meaning. Logically it does not. These are different spaces.
[21:22:58] PoorYorick: well, that depends if it was brillig or not, and if the slithy toves did or did not gyre and gimble in the wabe
[21:22:59] JIeBuc: in other words, true or false depends on subjective interpretation?
[21:23:40] Epsilion: linguistically it has no meaning; tell us what it means. it's poetry, intended by Carol to be nonsense
[21:24:48] ericj: agronski is pointing out the difference between linguistic and logical meaning. 
[21:24:58] ericj: nonsense verse is a special kind of nonsense, one of my favorites :)
[21:25:33] Epsilion: a sentence can be meaningful, but also be logically inconsistent. a sentence with no meaning whatsoever cannot be true, false or inconsistent
[21:26:24] Agronski: Such a sentence would need to be a random string of words, but that is accurate.
[21:26:47] PoorYorick: not _any_ random string :·P
[21:26:58] Epsilion: "I exist and I don't exist" 
[21:27:35] Epsilion: it's not meaningless, in fact it is meaningful but also a logical contradiction. so, we can say that it is false
[21:28:31] Agronski: Depending on the logic family, contradiction may imply truth, but in any case, it can be said to have a logical value, yes.
