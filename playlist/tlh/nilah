'Epsilion [5k]: hello usual suspects
LinuxGooo [9k]: it has 3 simple keys, Animation. 
LinuxGooo [9k]: very simple. 
Epsilion [5k]: I didn't know til today that disney removed john boyega from the chinese star wars posters
LinuxGooo [9k]: EGO
Epsilion [5k]: (he's black)
Epsilion [5k]: (so that it wouldn't impact their sales negatively)
LinuxGooo [9k]: children regularly are collaborative, by their nature. But as soon they come into government school, they are being teached selfishness, egoism .... I have seen this with kids I educated .... as soon children start with school examen and being judged ... ellbow society has its roots there. Its a system which teaches: You must be the best, you must be the winner ... otherwise you are a looser. Concurrence thinking, and from that jealousity, lack of self worth, mistrust, hatrate starts ... 
Animation [6k]: it's very sad, what a disaster
LinuxGooo [9k]: Is there any class to get teached, how to get own emotions under control ??? No..... not at all. Nobody get teached how to learn to get rid of false ego. 
Animation [6k]: i don't see many people as people anymore, more like farm animal
LinuxGooo [9k]: in asia, parents send their little kids to the monks, into the monastry. there they sit with 5-6 years old, and have to mediate. .... its painful ... its hard ... but it teaches devotion. One way to learn to handle own ego ..... not the only way. but where is such approach in Western world ? 
LinuxGooo [9k]: meditate*
LinuxGooo [9k]: ... and of course the system needs consumers: I want, I need, I desire .... whole marketing is focussing to evoke such emotions in people`s mind. Bigger car, cool house, fantastic holidays .... then you have made it. 
LinuxGooo [9k]: so all the mashinery of our markets target at to feed the ego. 
Animation [6k]: the entitlement feel is the most scary thing i ever seen
alfalfa [5k]: does china permit parents to send their kids to the monastery?
LinuxGooo [9k]: I was consultant in strategic marketing for global concerns. I left, because it became disgusting to see how the marketing departments like to manipulate the consumers. 
Animation [6k]: i'm sure Chinese all hate religion
LinuxGooo [9k]: Trump is a symptom par excellence of this egocentrism. He is just a mirror of the eogism in our modern societies. 
alfalfa [5k]: so, in  what countries in asia do parents send their kids to the monks?
LinuxGooo [9k]: officially in China religion is forbidden, so told me CHinese. 
Animation [6k]: China is a weird place, I've never been there but I can't imagine living under that government
Animation [6k]: It's lik they don't believe in human dignity
Animation [6k]: Then what's the point of living
kcinsgk [-]: kyu
LinuxGooo [9k]: one example in Mongolia, alfalfa ... https://www.diariesofmagazine.com/mongolian-child-monks/ 
alfalfa [5k]: ok
kcinsgk [-]: howdy
alfalfa [5k]: ivan!
kcinsgk [-]: john
kcinsgk [-]: my pc broked
kcinsgk [-]: losed all
kcinsgk [-]: all that was for 5 years
LinuxGooo [9k]: Here a summary, alfalfa ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_monasticism#Southeast_Asia 
alfalfa [5k]: ty
Animation [6k]: actually Linux i believe Trump is trying to do something good
LinuxGooo [9k]: I have seen a documentary about .... 
Animation [6k]: but i think society itself is fundamentally broken
kcinsgk [-]: america in  fire
kcinsgk [-]: seems putin
alfalfa [5k]: trump is lining his own pockets that's all
LinuxGooo [9k]: of course Trump thinks he is the good boy. In his own bubble of Trumpism he is the king who knows how things should be. He does not lack of self confidence to believe he is doing the best and he is the best this country deserves. 
alfalfa [5k]: the notion that he is "trying to do good"  is laughable
Animation [6k]: I think women today are lost, they suffer from low self-esteem
alfalfa [5k]: he deliberately uses hate to divide people
Marathon [8k]: not necessarily. it's possible the worst actually believe they were trying to do good.
alfalfa [5k]: why are there so many trump apologists today?
LinuxGooo [9k]: its like when "old rome" was in fire ... and this empire felt. Arrogance, Ignorance, Thinking in Superlatives ... every kind of society which becomes decadent ends in ashes. History shows us this again and again. Why should not USA fall ??
Marathon [8k]: i'm not a trump apologist.
LinuxGooo [9k]: look at Dragon Endeavour ... how it was praised: USA is back in space business... new vehicle, made by USA, launched from American soil. Disgusting words to hear .... thats ultra-nationalism: "We are the best". This still in 2020 with all the global problems we have ? 
Animation [6k]: ironically it's needs a south african to make it happen
LinuxGooo [9k]: From American soil...  It frozen me to hear such words .... like HItler preached: Germany to the Germans. Ashaming. 
LinuxGooo [9k]: is Elon Musk born in South Africa ? 
Animation [6k]: yes I believe he was born there
LinuxGooo [9k]: but in the press conference on Saturday after the launch he used also these words .... "... from American soil". Such kind of nationalistic propaganda in a globalized world ? 
LinuxGooo [9k]: suppose he wanted make all his investors of risk capital happy. 
Animation [6k]: Yes it's a bit silly praising onesslf
LinuxGooo [9k]: ... it only fires up hatress ... feeds national thinking and international conflicts ... not what we need nowadays I would say. 
Animation [6k]: trump acts like he's a bit retarded sometimes lol
AmyTS [?]: a bit?
Animation [6k]: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-coronavirus-began-accident-disease-escaped-chinese/
Animation [6k]: Amy i hesitate to judge ;)
alfalfa [5k]: i don't.
AmyTS [?]: the man is a goddamn moron who only knows how to feed his own ego
LinuxGooo [9k]: I cant take this guy serious. He is a disgrace for human mankind. Hugging flags, building walls of concrete, shut down of US government by purpopse which costed 17 billion US dollars, paying silence money to porn stars ... etc. etc. etc. ... I cant watch it anymore. 
alfalfa [5k]: trump is an utter imbecile
Animation [6k]: A former head of MI6 has said he believes the coronavirus pandemic "started as an accident" when the virus escaped from a laboratory in China.   In an interview with The Telegraph, Sir Richard Dearlove said he had seen an "important" new scientific report suggesting the virus did not emerge naturally but was man-made by Chinese scientists.  
LinuxGooo [9k]: for what creating such virus ? 
LinuxGooo [9k]: as biological weapon ? 
Animation [6k]: yes
Animation [6k]: you don't think it will stop with only this one do you?
LinuxGooo [9k]: hm .... they should learn first the virus language to tell covid-19. Only infect our enemies, but dont harm our own population. Virus: What are you telling me ? 
LinuxGooo [9k]: I think we will get used to covid-19 like we know it with annual flue. 
Animation [6k]: this virus is just a beginning as we get better at genetic engineering
LinuxGooo [9k]: it will come back again and again. 
AmyTS [?]: what new important scientific report is that?  it wasn't published in a peer reviewed journal i know of
AmyTS [?]: for all i know, Boris's MI6 guy is lying.
LinuxGooo [9k]: maybe some secret papers. 
AmyTS [?]: Oh, a secret report.
LinuxGooo [9k]: maybe
LinuxGooo [9k]: I dont know
AmyTS [?]: Well lets see it
AmyTS [?]: Because that isn't the finding of the actual scientific community.
Marathon [8k]: you can't! it's secret!
Animation [6k]: true
AmyTS [?]: So I conclude he's making it up, and you want to believe him for some reason.
Animation [6k]: The article does say that 'International scientists have reached a near-unanimous consensus, however, that the virus emerged in animals – most likely bats or pangolins – before jumping to the human population....  To continue reading this article...   '
LinuxGooo [9k]: only trump knows the truth. Every other kind of source is "fake news". 
LinuxGooo [9k]: how does a scientist can find the source and track it back ??? From Bats to humans. Hey bats .... do you have covid-19? Did you bite a human like Drakula ? Bat .... I am innocent. 
Animation [6k]: the size of the genome of this virus is more than double the size of other coronavirii found in bats
LinuxGooo [9k]: you must catch hundreds of bats and other animals to analyse their blood to know if this is the source, isnt ? 
Epsilion [5k]: hello controversy my old friend
alfalfa [5k]: it begins with testing
alfalfa [5k]: the test results will show a pattern that reflects the epidemiological history
Animation [6k]: bat virii are extremely deadly, it will kill the patient very quickly
alfalfa [5k]: if there is an area where there are a lot of positives, you can be sure that it _did_ spread there
Animation [6k]: there is another disease called nipah virus from bat droppings
alfalfa [5k]: with more testing you get more accuracy
alfalfa [5k]: in determining just how this happened, because regiions will be in some part of the "wave" as time progresses
