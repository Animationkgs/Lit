Given that a HUGE proportion of demonstrators are young people, I fervently hope that they will turn out in droves to vote  in November. Their vote, I believe, will be the crucial momentum to change, most specifically, at the White House.

Perhaps.  I wish the Dems would offer EVERYONE more than "We are not Trump".   As for turn out, I will believe it when I see it.
BTW, thanks for the mention of BlackPAC. I am looking for groups to support that focus on turning out the vote.

I'd like to point out also that his response to Hurricane Maria and the devastation in Puerto Rico, and his constant rhetoric about the "hordes" of rapists and drug dealers from Mexico and Central America should not have earned him much support from that portion of our electorate.  This man has made it plain as day that he does not like or respect most people of color.  He'll use you if he can, but only as a prop.  You will never get equal justice or treatment under the laws of our constitution under his 'leadership'.  Remember that (as though we could forget it), register to vote as soon as possible, and then VOTE.

The Democrats will have the most progressive platform it has ever had.  The Republicans will circle the wagons and tell white Americans to be afraid because of the "other."  The former is a vote for hope and progress, and the latter is a vote for violence and fear.

y their priority for a vice president is simply that the candidate — black or white — increases Mr. Biden’s chance of winning. In late May, polls showed the top choice for Mr. Biden’s vice president among black and white Democrats was Senator Elizabeth Warren.

It’s likely that Mr. Trump is now hoping that suburban white voters will be so frightened by the protests against police violence and news footage of broken windows at Target stores that they will turn to him in sufficient numbers to nullify the black vote. Stoking racial divisions may work for his base, but not for voters in the middle. Polls show most independents have already decided they can’t support Mr. Trump. Now they have seen the tape of Mr. Floyd dying. Violent protests may make them anxious, but they have had their eyes opened to injustice.

These are dark days, but black voters’ profile and power have never been this high. They have the chance to lead the nation to recovery. Civil rights leaders, who pushed for the 1965 Voting Rights Act and had their blood spilled to register black voters, dreamed of this moment.

People want real change not the establishment, cosmetic ,all talk and little action kind that Juan Williams is promoting here. The Democrats want to put us to sleep again while they talk about peace and unity but hardly do anything of significance. All they have ever done in the last twenty or so years is try to appease the other party and cower in the face of opposition. Joe Biden  is the very face of that establishment type, like Hilary was. Obama was not when he came in but he quickly adopted to their cowering posture.

With all of the noise about national vote-by-mail, there is already vote-by-mail in the few states that Trump needs to win.  If Democrats get organized and make sure that their constituents 1. apply to vote 2. vote and 3. return the ballots promptly, our national nightmare will draw to a close.

Gavin Newsom nearly lost the 2003 mayoral race in San Francisco, but for Alex Tourk's aggressive mail-in effort on the City's west side.

If some Democratic operative reads this and has the position to tap Tourk to work his magic in Florida and the upper midwest, please investigate this potential.

@Robert M. Koretsky Democratic voters in the primaries did NOT go for Bernie sufficiently to make him the nominee. His touted popularity with younger voters simply didn't materialize in practice. If he couldn't get enough votes to win even in the primaries, it seems highly unlikely he could get enough to win the general election. You may consider Biden problematic, but you should give minority voters the respect of believing that they voted for the person whom they thought best placed to win the general election and be in a position to start turning this country around.

Take a break from chanting and take action to register voters.

November is the most important election of our lives.

As protestors are marching, Republican operatives are working feverishly to strip voter rolls, enact laws to close or restrict polling places, campaign to reject "mail-in" ballot laws and overall, make it harder to vote throughout the country.

Black folks showed us white youth, through their deep commitment, effective organization and largely peaceful pressure what it takes to bring about some degree of civil rights progress in America during the 50’s and 60’s. Masses of boomer youth copied them and protested when the military draft put skin in the game in Vietnam for white children of privilege.
For most drafted 60’s college kids like me, serving in the military during that era was a real eye-opener. And for those with openness and empathy, it was a deeply emotional feeling of brotherhood. Then the draft and Vietnam “went away, like a miracle” as President Bone Spurs would say. And for too many of us protesting youth, solidarity with people of color, the poor and marginalized, also went away, like a prolonged sigh. That feeling of brotherhood became a lament, salved by the “maturity” of middle age, rapidly increasing incomes, and the busy-ness of other plans, as life happened for, or to, those less fortunate members of the brotherhood.
And here we are. It would be more than fitting now if it were women, especially black women who were to lead. God knows, they are prepared. They’ve been cleaning up messes after the rest of us for way too long.

What most reinforces Juan Williams' argument is the President's behavior over the last few days.

From the casual "MAGA loves the black people"  (no one talks like that) to his calls for police violence against demonstrators and his reference to loosing fierce dogs on them, just about everything Trump has said in our current hour of crisis is tinged with racism.

Sending troops against demonstrators (multiracial, to be sure but protesting police brutality against blacks) just so he could stage a photo op at a  church with a bible in hand, the President has encouraged fear of blacks in his base, many of whom do not "love the black people".

The question I have is why does Trump still have substantial support among another minority, Latinos.  Sure, a majority will vote for Joe Biden, or any Democratic candidate, but Trump's persecution, fed by his ideologist, Stephen Miller, of Latino children at the border ought to have persuaded conservative Latinos that Trump is not their guy.

Perhaps there is no such thing as a Latino vote, only the votes of disparate Latino communities.  At any rate, the phenomena deserves serious examination.

Anyone looking at all the peaceful protests around this country right now will see that the crowds are multi-racial and multi-generational.  Not only have African Americans taken to the streets in large numbers, but they have been joined by many white people, including voting age young adults, seniors and middle-aged people. We have reached a tipping point in this country, we’re fed up and are not going back. If addressing systemic racism in this country is not part of your presidential platform, you will LOSE!

I will say, I personally believe Bernie Sanders has an equal or better record of supporting black people's causes, and would have been a better president to them, but the black community chose Joe.

Mr. William contextualizes Trump's actions and rhetoric perfectly.  He is using the same intimidation tactics that were used during Jim Crow to support the actions of a government agency (the police) to keep Blacks mindful of who owns the law and everything else.  Trump is an image based thinker, so when he says, "viscous dogs" we all see the iconic photograph of Black people being attacked by German shepherd police dogs.  That's where the grotesque and unbridled demonstration of military and police force is coming from in his and his supporters' minds.  The election is about the difference between racism being a right and racism being government policy that the police and military seem unable to question.  Trump and the Republicans own everything, including the monopoly on the making and enforcing of law.  They will not share.  Some voters will find that appealing, won't they?

I am frightened, not by the protests but by the way they are being mishandled by law enforcement and Trump.  Rather than using this as an opportunity to change things for the better Trump is contributing to the anger and, even worse, approving of violence against peaceful protestors as well as lumping them in with the inevitable instigators who tag along with these events.  Trump refuses to understand his role in this.  The GOP's senior leadership is supporting Trump, not American citizens who they are sworn to support and represent.

We all bleed red when we're cut.  We all need the same things in life.  What we don't need is a president and party exacerbating an already tense situation.  I was horrified by the brutality I watched in the video, especially when Chauvin taunted Mr. Floyd.  How dare he use his power to murder someone in his custody.  Where was his humanity when he did that?  Why didn't the other officers object?

It's reached the point where no American should feel safe.  We've elected people who see nothing wrong with stripping all of us of our basic rights in order to stay in power.  The GOP is not the party for businesses or for law abiding Americans or anyone unless they are extremely rich.  They have betrayed Americans and should be haunted nightly by the voices of those whose dreams they've destroyed.

Moderate and conservative black voters, by this accounting, make up nearly 70% of the demographic.  It's hard to know what that means.  Do they want more corporate tax cuts and tax cuts for the wealthy?  Do they want to cut social security and medicare to balance the budget?  Do they support more wars of intervention all over the world? Do they want to abandon Obamacare?  Do they oppose same sex marriage or protections for gay folks?  Do they oppose abortion?

I'm not sure I have much use for those voters.  Maybe they would be better served by other than the Democratic Party.

This does not and cannot begin in the voting booth.  So many politicians are overtly or covertly racist (and misogynist, and . . . ) because the voters who elect them are.  They won't admit it; in fact, they'll deny it at the top of their lungs.  But they will vote for it, over and over again.  Their denials are about as credible as Donald Trump declaring himself the "least prejudiced person" we will ever see.  Many of these are the same people who, professing to be observant Christians, vote for a man who is the antithesis of everything for which Jesus stands.  How does a single mind hold both of those thoughts?

A substantial part of the citizenry believe that black people are and should be inferior.  They learn it in their homes and in their communities.  Their schools reinforce it, in ways both subtle and unsubtle.  The police play into it, far too often.  Consider the look on Derek Chauvin's face at he stared into the camera recording his murder of George Floyd.  It is not simply stony; it is defiant.  "I'm doing this, and there is nothing you can do about it."

Our country is deeply steeped in racism, and we transmit it from generation to generation, and have, for 400 years.  An election is not going to change that.  Change begins in the homes--or doesn't begin in the homes.

Rep. Jim Clyburn and his Black constituents helped make Joe Biden the Democratic party's Hail Mary. We have to unite to make him The People's Choice. Let's not kid ourselves. It will be tough.

We have to overcome not only the racist voter suppression of the right.  We must also overcome false equivalency defeatism on the left which divides the vote.

The abuses of the Trump administration should dispel leftist assertions that there is no difference between the parties, but don't bet on it. Even though communities of color, who they claim to care about, are in the crosshairs.

Black voters in Milwaukee, under a corona death sentence imposed by the Roberts Supreme Court, went out and elected a Democratic judge. Now it's our turn to elect a Democratic president.

With all of the noise about national vote-by-mail, there is already vote-by-mail in the few states that Trump needs to win.  If Democrats get organized and make sure that their constituents 1. apply to vote 2. vote and 3. return the ballots promptly, our national nightmare will draw to a close.

Gavin Newsom nearly lost the 2003 mayoral race in San Francisco, but for Alex Tourk's aggressive mail-in effort on the City's west side.

If some Democratic operative reads this and has the position to tap Tourk to work his magic in Florida and the upper midwest, please investigate this potential.

@Irene I too hope that young people turn out in droves to vote blue in November, but young voters are statistically the least likely to actually vote. Bernie predicted that a surge of young voters, his supposed base, would propel him toward victory in the primaries. Alas, the opposite was true. Low voting rates among the young persisted, and Bernie fizzled out. I put my faith in black voters. It's on the Dems to motivate this group to vote and drive the blues to victory.

@Robert M. Koretsky Democratic voters in the primaries did NOT go for Bernie sufficiently to make him the nominee. His touted popularity with younger voters simply didn't materialize in practice. If he couldn't get enough votes to win even in the primaries, it seems highly unlikely he could get enough to win the general election. You may consider Biden problematic, but you should give minority voters the respect of believing that they voted for the person whom they thought best placed to win the general election and be in a position to start turning this country around.

Black voters can protest and register voters at the same time.

Voter registration booths should be at the center of every rally.  

Remember the old saying...Action speaks louder than words?

Take a break from chanting and take action to register voters.

November is the most important election of our lives.

As protestors are marching, Republican operatives are working feverishly to strip voter rolls, enact laws to close or restrict polling places, campaign to reject "mail-in" ballot laws and overall, make it harder to vote throughout the country. 

Time to show the "Vote Suppressing GOP" that their obstruct the vote tactics will NOT work.

Amen. I do hope Juan Williams is correct in his analysis.
Black folks showed us white youth, through their deep commitment, effective organization and largely peaceful pressure what it takes to bring about some degree of civil rights progress in America during the 50’s and 60’s. Masses of boomer youth copied them and protested when the military draft put skin in the game in Vietnam for white children of privilege. 
For most drafted 60’s college kids like me, serving in the military during that era was a real eye-opener. And for those with openness and empathy, it was a deeply emotional feeling of brotherhood. Then the draft and Vietnam “went away, like a miracle” as President Bone Spurs would say. And for too many of us protesting youth, solidarity with people of color, the poor and marginalized, also went away, like a prolonged sigh. That feeling of brotherhood became a lament, salved by the “maturity” of middle age, rapidly increasing incomes, and the busy-ness of other plans, as life happened for, or to, those less fortunate members of the brotherhood. 
And here we are. It would be more than fitting now if it were women, especially black women who were to lead. God knows, they are prepared. They’ve been cleaning up messes after the rest of us for way too long.

What most reinforces Juan Williams' argument is the President's behavior over the last few days.

From the casual "MAGA loves the black people"  (no one talks like that) to his calls for police violence against demonstrators and his reference to loosing fierce dogs on them, just about everything Trump has said in our current hour of crisis is tinged with racism. 

Sending troops against demonstrators (multiracial, to be sure but protesting police brutality against blacks) just so he could stage a photo op at a  church with a bible in hand, the President has encouraged fear of blacks in his base, many of whom do not "love the black people".  

The question I have is why does Trump still have substantial support among another minority, Latinos.  Sure, a majority will vote for Joe Biden, or any Democratic candidate, but Trump's persecution, fed by his ideologist, Stephen Miller, of Latino children at the border ought to have persuaded conservative Latinos that Trump is not their guy.  

Perhaps there is no such thing as a Latino vote, only the votes of disparate Latino communities.  At any rate, the phenomena deserves serious examination.

Anyone looking at all the peaceful protests around this country right now will see that the crowds are multi-racial and multi-generational.  Not only have African Americans taken to the streets in large numbers, but they have been joined by many white people, including voting age young adults, seniors and middle-aged people. We have reached a tipping point in this country, we’re fed up and are not going back. If addressing systemic racism in this country is not part of your presidential platform, you will LOSE!

I will say, I personally believe Bernie Sanders has an equal or better record of supporting black people's causes, and would have been a better president to them, but the black community chose Joe.

Mr. William contextualizes Trump's actions and rhetoric perfectly.  He is using the same intimidation tactics that were used during Jim Crow to support the actions of a government agency (the police) to keep Blacks mindful of who owns the law and everything else.  Trump is an image based thinker, so when he says, "viscous dogs" we all see the iconic photograph of Black people being attacked by German shepherd police dogs.  That's where the grotesque and unbridled demonstration of military and police force is coming from in his and his supporters' minds.  The election is about the difference between racism being a right and racism being government policy that the police and military seem unable to question.  Trump and the Republicans own everything, including the monopoly on the making and enforcing of law.  They will not share.  Some voters will find that appealing, won't they?

I am frightened, not by the protests but by the way they are being mishandled by law enforcement and Trump.  Rather than using this as an opportunity to change things for the better Trump is contributing to the anger and, even worse, approving of violence against peaceful protestors as well as lumping them in with the inevitable instigators who tag along with these events.  Trump refuses to understand his role in this.  The GOP's senior leadership is supporting Trump, not American citizens who they are sworn to support and represent.  

We all bleed red when we're cut.  We all need the same things in life.  What we don't need is a president and party exacerbating an already tense situation.  I was horrified by the brutality I watched in the video, especially when Chauvin taunted Mr. Floyd.  How dare he use his power to murder someone in his custody.  Where was his humanity when he did that?  Why didn't the other officers object?  

It's reached the point where no American should feel safe.  We've elected people who see nothing wrong with stripping all of us of our basic rights in order to stay in power.  The GOP is not the party for businesses or for law abiding Americans or anyone unless they are extremely rich.  They have betrayed Americans and should be haunted nightly by the voices of those whose dreams they've destroyed.

Moderate and conservative black voters, by this accounting, make up nearly 70% of the demographic.  It's hard to know what that means.  Do they want more corporate tax cuts and tax cuts for the wealthy?  Do they want to cut social security and medicare to balance the budget?  Do they support more wars of intervention all over the world? Do they want to abandon Obamacare?  Do they oppose same sex marriage or protections for gay folks?  Do they oppose abortion?  

I'm not sure I have much use for those voters.  Maybe they would be better served by other than the Democratic Party.

This does not and cannot begin in the voting booth.  So many politicians are overtly or covertly racist (and misogynist, and . . . ) because the voters who elect them are.  They won't admit it; in fact, they'll deny it at the top of their lungs.  But they will vote for it, over and over again.  Their denials are about as credible as Donald Trump declaring himself the "least prejudiced person" we will ever see.  Many of these are the same people who, professing to be observant Christians, vote for a man who is the antithesis of everything for which Jesus stands.  How does a single mind hold both of those thoughts?

A substantial part of the citizenry believe that black people are and should be inferior.  They learn it in their homes and in their communities.  Their schools reinforce it, in ways both subtle and unsubtle.  The police play into it, far too often.  Consider the look on Derek Chauvin's face at he stared into the camera recording his murder of George Floyd.  It is not simply stony; it is defiant.  "I'm doing this, and there is nothing you can do about it."

Our country is deeply steeped in racism, and we transmit it from generation to generation, and have, for 400 years.  An election is not going to change that.  Change begins in the homes--or doesn't begin in the homes.

Either Senator Harris or Warren would make a great Vice Presidential candidate.  My suggestion is that the one who is not chosen as VP be appointed Attorney General.  Both are fighters.  And if Biden serves only one term, as I think he should, both could aggressively compete with Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2024.

 is now hoping that suburban white voters will be so frightened by the protests against police violence and news footage of broken windows at Target stores that they will turn to him in sufficient numbers to nullify the black vote.

It is long overdue that black voices be the predominant voices in an election.After 100s of years of voter suppression, it is long overdue that their votes decide an election.People of color built this country and now, hopefully, they will have a say in how we proceed from here.

With all of the noise about national vote-by-mail, there is already vote-by-mail in the few states that Trump needs to win.  If Democrats get organized and make sure that their constituents 1. apply to vote 2. vote and 3. return the ballots promptly, our national nightmare will draw to a close.

Gavin Newsom nearly lost the 2003 mayoral race in San Francisco, but for Alex Tourk's aggressive mail-in effort on the City's west side.

If some Democratic operative reads this and has the position to tap Tourk to work his magic in Florida and the upper midwest, please investigate this potential.

Bottom line- the VP choice rarely decides an election.  In the end, people focus on those at the top of the ticket.

I do think Kamala Harris would help a great deal, though.

Given that a HUGE proportion of demonstrators are young people, I fervently hope that they will turn out in droves to vote  in November. Their vote, I believe, will be the crucial momentum to change, most specifically, at the White House.

@Irene I too hope that young people turn out in droves to vote blue in November, but young voters are statistically the least likely to actually vote. Bernie predicted that a surge of young voters, his supposed base, would propel him toward victory in the primaries. Alas, the opposite was true. Low voting rates among the young persisted, and Bernie fizzled out. I put my faith in black voters. It's on the Dems to motivate this group to vote and drive the blues to victory.

With Biden, they’re kicking the can down the road again- nothing will change under him and a centrist administration. Business as usual. This article proves that hegemony- voting against your best interests, is alive and well in divided America. Bernie and a progressive revolution would have addressed many more of the issues that confront minorities now, but who do the minorities select? The same old same old.

@Robert M. Koretsky Democratic voters in the primaries did NOT go for Bernie sufficiently to make him the nominee. His touted popularity with younger voters simply didn't materialize in practice. If he couldn't get enough votes to win even in the primaries, it seems highly unlikely he could get enough to win the general election. You may consider Biden problematic, but you should give minority voters the respect of believing that they voted for the person whom they thought best placed to win the general election and be in a position to start turning this country around.

Black voters can protest and register voters at the same time.

Voter registration booths should be at the center of every rally.

Remember the old saying...Action speaks louder than words?

Take a break from chanting and take action to register voters.

November is the most important election of our lives.

As protestors are marching, Republican operatives are working feverishly to strip voter rolls, enact laws to close or restrict polling places, campaign to reject "mail-in" ballot laws and overall, make it harder to vote throughout the country.

Time to show the "Vote Suppressing GOP" that their obstruct the vote tactics will NOT work.

PROTEST, REGISTER AND VOTE

Amen. I do hope Juan Williams is correct in his analysis.
Black folks showed us white youth, through their deep commitment, effective organization and largely peaceful pressure what it takes to bring about some degree of civil rights progress in America during the 50’s and 60’s. Masses of boomer youth copied them and protested when the military draft put skin in the game in Vietnam for white children of privilege.
For most drafted 60’s college kids like me, serving in the military during that era was a real eye-opener. And for those with openness and empathy, it was a deeply emotional feeling of brotherhood. Then the draft and Vietnam “went away, like a miracle” as President Bone Spurs would say. And for too many of us protesting youth, solidarity with people of color, the poor and marginalized, also went away, like a prolonged sigh. That feeling of brotherhood became a lament, salved by the “maturity” of middle age, rapidly increasing incomes, and the busy-ness of other plans, as life happened for, or to, those less fortunate members of the brotherhood.
And here we are. It would be more than fitting now if it were women, especially black women who were to lead. God knows, they are prepared. They’ve been cleaning up messes after the rest of us for way too long.

What most reinforces Juan Williams' argument is the President's behavior over the last few days.

From the casual "MAGA loves the black people"  (no one talks like that) to his calls for police violence against demonstrators and his reference to loosing fierce dogs on them, just about everything Trump has said in our current hour of crisis is tinged with racism.

Sending troops against demonstrators (multiracial, to be sure but protesting police brutality against blacks) just so he could stage a photo op at a  church with a bible in hand, the President has encouraged fear of blacks in his base, many of whom do not "love the black people".

The question I have is why does Trump still have substantial support among another minority, Latinos.  Sure, a majority will vote for Joe Biden, or any Democratic candidate, but Trump's persecution, fed by his ideologist, Stephen Miller, of Latino children at the border ought to have persuaded conservative Latinos that Trump is not their guy.

Perhaps there is no such thing as a Latino vote, only the votes of disparate Latino communities.  At any rate, the phenomena deserves serious examination.

Anyone looking at all the peaceful protests around this country right now will see that the crowds are multi-racial and multi-generational.  Not only have African Americans taken to the streets in large numbers, but they have been joined by many white people, including voting age young adults, seniors and middle-aged people. We have reached a tipping point in this country, we’re fed up and are not going back. If addressing systemic racism in this country is not part of your presidential platform, you will LOSE!

I will say, I personally believe Bernie Sanders has an equal or better record of supporting black people's causes, and would have been a better president to them, but the black community chose Joe.
If I were a black American I would be prepared to regularly be on the steps of the White House of a Biden presidency in order to get the changes I desire and deserve.

Mr. William contextualizes Trump's actions and rhetoric perfectly.  He is using the same intimidation tactics that were used during Jim Crow to support the actions of a government agency (the police) to keep Blacks mindful of who owns the law and everything else.  Trump is an image based thinker, so when he says, "viscous dogs" we all see the iconic photograph of Black people being attacked by German shepherd police dogs.  That's where the grotesque and unbridled demonstration of military and police force is coming from in his and his supporters' minds.  The election is about the difference between racism being a right and racism being government policy that the police and military seem unable to question.  Trump and the Republicans own everything, including the monopoly on the making and enforcing of law.  They will not share.  Some voters will find that appealing, won't they?

I am frightened, not by the protests but by the way they are being mishandled by law enforcement and Trump.  Rather than using this as an opportunity to change things for the better Trump is contributing to the anger and, even worse, approving of violence against peaceful protestors as well as lumping them in with the inevitable instigators who tag along with these events.  Trump refuses to understand his role in this.  The GOP's senior leadership is supporting Trump, not American citizens who they are sworn to support and represent.

We all bleed red when we're cut.  We all need the same things in life.  What we don't need is a president and party exacerbating an already tense situation.  I was horrified by the brutality I watched in the video, especially when Chauvin taunted Mr. Floyd.  How dare he use his power to murder someone in his custody.  Where was his humanity when he did that?  Why didn't the other officers object?

It's reached the point where no American should feel safe.  We've elected people who see nothing wrong with stripping all of us of our basic rights in order to stay in power.  The GOP is not the party for businesses or for law abiding Americans or anyone unless they are extremely rich.  They have betrayed Americans and should be haunted nightly by the voices of those whose dreams they've destroyed.

Moderate and conservative black voters, by this accounting, make up nearly 70% of the demographic.  It's hard to know what that means.  Do they want more corporate tax cuts and tax cuts for the wealthy?  Do they want to cut social security and medicare to balance the budget?  Do they support more wars of intervention all over the world? Do they want to abandon Obamacare?  Do they oppose same sex marriage or protections for gay folks?  Do they oppose abortion?

I'm not sure I have much use for those voters.  Maybe they would be better served by other than the Democratic Party.

This does not and cannot begin in the voting booth.  So many politicians are overtly or covertly racist (and misogynist, and . . . ) because the voters who elect them are.  They won't admit it; in fact, they'll deny it at the top of their lungs.  But they will vote for it, over and over again.  Their denials are about as credible as Donald Trump declaring himself the "least prejudiced person" we will ever see.  Many of these are the same people who, professing to be observant Christians, vote for a man who is the antithesis of everything for which Jesus stands.  How does a single mind hold both of those thoughts?

A substantial part of the citizenry believe that black people are and should be inferior.  They learn it in their homes and in their communities.  Their schools reinforce it, in ways both subtle and unsubtle.  The police play into it, far too often.  Consider the look on Derek Chauvin's face at he stared into the camera recording his murder of George Floyd.  It is not simply stony; it is defiant.  "I'm doing this, and there is nothing you can do about it."

Our country is deeply steeped in racism, and we transmit it from generation to generation, and have, for 400 years.  An election is not going to change that.  Change begins in the homes--or doesn't begin in the homes.

Rep. Jim Clyburn and his Black constituents helped make Joe Biden the Democratic party's Hail Mary. We have to unite to make him The People's Choice. Let's not kid ourselves. It will be tough.

We have to overcome not only the racist voter suppression of the right.  We must also overcome false equivalency defeatism on the left which divides the vote.

The abuses of the Trump administration should dispel leftist assertions that there is no difference between the parties, but don't bet on it. Even though communities of color, who they claim to care about, are in the crosshairs.

Black voters in Milwaukee, under a corona death sentence imposed by the Roberts Supreme Court, went out and elected a Democratic judge. Now it's our turn to elect a Democratic president.

I see comments like yours a lot.  The presidency does not represent one position in the government, it's not a binary function.

Consider the alphabet soup of governmental agencies that have been undermined, and their missions twisted by the Trump administration.  A vote for any generic Democratic presidential candidate would yield a return to functionality for the DOJ, State Department, CDC, EPA, Treasury, Energy, HEW, etc etc.

Either Senator Harris or Warren would make a great Vice Presidential candidate.  My suggestion is that the one who is not chosen as VP be appointed Attorney General.  Both are fighters.  And if Biden serves only one term, as I think he should, both could aggressively compete with Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2024.

The editorial says: "It (the Black vote) is at the heart of the fight to take back America."  Five years ago I was outraged at the Tea Party slogan "Take our country back."  Take it back from whom? I demanded.  From me?  Isn't it my country too?

Please, let's not talk that way now. This country does not belong to one party or the other, to one or the other set of economic or social beliefs.  As a Democrat and a fairly consistent liberal, yes, I want my party to regain control of Congress and the White House.  For a while.  For long enough to implement some of our best ideas. But not forever.  We don't want a one-party state -- do we?

And I don't want the people I agree with to talk about our country as if it belongs exclusively to "our side."  Let's restore the concept of a loyal opposition.  And let's respect the fact that the USA is ALL of our country.

I have no desire to live in a plutocracy, but here we are.

We the people need to take our country back from the corporations and 1%ers who have destroyed our safety nets, caused so much financial ruin for so many people, made the middle class poor, and the poor poorer.

1) Because of gerrymandering. When 60% of voters vote for the Democrat, but the Republican wins anyway, it's discouraging.

When 3.7 million MORE people vote for the Democrat (in 2016 that Democrat was Hillary Clinton) but because of the antiquated structure of the electoral college, she loses and Trump wins, it's absolutely demoralizing.

But we overcame gerrymandering in the last midterms, and we now have a Democratic controlled House of Reps. It can be done.

1. For Real Change we need to focus on issues, & not personalize politics. Tribal/party identity has subsumed other layers of our Politicians' identities. Republican women Senators generally supported Kavanaugh's confirmation. Democrat male senators believed the charges against him. Party/tribal identity subsumed gender identity here. The same applied to the Impeachment hearings. Trump isn't the only one playing to a tribal base.
2.If this national uprising sought to establish Independent Election Commissions at state level, gerrymandering might stop. With heterogeneous bases, politicians have to adopt multiple focus on: Systemic racism, Poverty across racial lines, inadequate funding  of Public schools, disproportionate incarceration of minority segments, gun violence, public health etc. The extreme Stephen King positions will get tossed.
3. The weakened Social Contract that binds citizens together gets strengthened. The slogan: "We are all in this together" will cease to ring hollow.
The Protest movement should not stop with the arrest of the 3 Police abettors in Minneapolis, if Real Change is the goal.

Trump pays lip service to his "support" for black people, and his campaign has creatively thrown some money and attention at issues important to them, such as support for HBCU's, etc. He claims credit for low black unemployment, but the overall economy was probably more the cause than anything he has done (at least until COVID hit).

Remember, his presidency is a reality TV show, so everything he claims credit for is actually window dressing to check a box that he has "done something." Does anyone dispute that his words are hollow?

His actions? Rubber bullets, tear gas, and calling protesters "thugs."  The party of Lincoln has become the party of George Wallace and Vladimir Putin.
