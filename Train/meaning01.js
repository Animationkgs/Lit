"M. Krassnine?"



"I am he," said Boris. "I must apologize for - for the
unconventionality of this meeting-place. But secrecy is urgent. I - I
cannot afford to be connected with this business in any way."



"Is that so?" said the American politely.



"I have your word, have I not, that no details of this transaction will
be made public? That is one of the conditions of - sale."



The American nodded.



"That has already been agreed upon," he said indifferently. "Now, perhaps, you will produce the goods."



"You have the money - in notes?"



"Yes," replied the other.



He did not, however, make any attempt to produce it. After a
moment's hesitation, Krassnine gestured towards the small parcel
on the table.



The American took it up and unrolled the wrapping paper. The
contents he took over to a small electric lamp and submitted them
to a very thorough examination. Satisfied, he drew from his pocket
a thick leather wallet and extracted from it a wad of notes. These
he handed to the Russian, who counted them carefully.



"All right?"



"I thank you, Monsieur. Everything is correct."



"Ah!" said the other. He slipped the brown paper parcel
negligently into his pocket. He bowed to Olga. "Good evening,
Mademoiselle. Good evening, M. Krassnine."



He went out, shutting the door behind him. The eyes of the two in
the room met. The man passed his tongue over his dry lips.



"I wonder - will he ever get back to his hotel?" he muttered.



By common accord, they both turned to the window. They were
just in time to see the American emerge into the street below.



He turned to the left and marched along at a good pace without
once turning his head. Two shadows stole from a doorway and
followed noiselessly. Pursuers and pursued vanished into the
night. Olga Demiroff spoke.



"He will get back safely," she said. "You need not fear - or hope -
whichever it is."



"Why do you think he will be safe?" asked Krassnine curiously.



"A man who has made as much money as he has could not
possibly be a fool," said Olga. "And talking of money -"



She looked significantly at Krassnine.



"Eh?"



"My share, Boris Ivanovitch."



With some reluctance, Krassnine handed over two of the notes.
She nodded her thanks, with a complete lack of emotion, and
tucked them away in her stocking.



"That is good," she remarked, with satisfaction.



He looked at her curiously.



"You have no regrets, Olga Vassilovna?"



"Regrets? For what?"



"For what has been in your keeping. There are women - most
women, I believe, who go mad over such things."



She nodded reflectively.



"Yes, you speak truth there. Most women have that madness. I -
have not. I wonder now -" She broke off.



"Well?" asked the other curiously.



"The American will be safe with them - yes, I am sure of that. But
afterwards -"



"Eh? What are you thinking of?"



"He will give them, of course, to some woman," said Olga
thoughtfully. "I wonder what will happen then..."



She shook herself impatiently and went over to the window.
Suddenly she uttered an exclamation and called to her
companion.



"See, he is going down the street now - the man I mean."



They both gazed down together. A slim, elegant figure was
progressing along at a leisurely pace. He wore an opera hat and a
cloak. As he passed a street lamp, the light illuminated a thatch of
thick white hair.`
